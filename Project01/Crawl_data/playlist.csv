This week we look at how the internet is connecting our world in new ways. 

Joseph Sifakis, winner of ACM A.M. Turing Award in 2007 and an Emeritus Senior CNRS Researcher at the Verimag lab in Grenoble explains the security risks of the Internet of Things. We also speak to
 Ashish Rauniyar, a PhD student at the University of Oslo in Norway about what better security mechanisms would look like.


Vinton Cerf, winner of ACM A.M. Turing Award in 2004, and the vice President and chief Internet evangelist for Google talks about what planetary internet system would look like.


In UnScience we look at whether dogs can actually smell our fears.


The Science Inside is presented by Elna Schütz and DJ Keyez. Our production team is Gabriel Chemhuru with technical production by Kutlwano Serame. Original concept by Paul McNally.

Our aim is to develop a collaborative group of resilience researchers, in order to develop high quality resilience research. More specifically we focus on improving access to, understanding of, and quality of resilience research, and aiding resilience researchers in effectively developing and disseminating their research. 

This podcast series will discuss what resilience is, the research around it, and how it fits in with our daily lives and wider society. While we will talk about specific research, the podcast is aimed at the general public, to raise awareness of what resilience is and how it can be explored or used, and to encourage dialogue around current resilience research.",2021-10-18T08:26:48Z,3,https://soundcloud.com/uclsound/sets/resilience-research-group,0,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1296368473,2427644,"1099953343,1100562934,1100563969,1118290810,1143676708",5,4:31:28,2021-08-05T12:13:41.000Z,3 months ago

It's been nearly two years since Rework last appeared on Items & Things with their stunning 'Blackout' EP, but the wait is over as they return bearing their trademark sound and unassailable attitude on their new 'Missed You At L EP.

Equal parts acid, techno, punk rock, and house, the EP covers a lot of ground in four compelling tracks. Kicking things off is the title track from the EP and it sees the trio stepping back into the sound of their Playhouse days using a never ending vocal loop, lush pad sweeps, and playful stabs laid over energetic, agile drums. Quickly flipping the script, 'Dry Acid' takes a turn into the more 'ghetto' side of techno, relentlessly pushing the groove with an attitude fueled ride of pitched toms and nimble percussion. 'Don't Make Me Cry' is the high octane tune of the EP and clearly has the most sinister demeanor using a quintessential Rework vocal treatment and rapid percussion to take things to the peak. Closing things out is 'French Candy' and the EP comes full circle returning to a sound resembling what Rework is best known for lighthearted and energetic dance floor jams with a deliberate touch of sincerity.

Welcome back, Rework. It's good to hear you again!",2015-11-05T12:19:06Z,169,https://soundcloud.com/itemsandthings/sets/rework-missed-you-at-l-ep,28,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/162298655,35268,"230833613,231181450,231381822,231528646",4,23:41,2015-11-05T12:16:47.000Z,6 years ago

Louh returns with his second solo EP on Les Points. Expect 5 signature psychedelic acid cuts. 

Moonchild they call me, because I only appear once a month during full moon.  I was once saved by the damned & doomed; now I have awoken from a structural nightmare. In my new & limited existence, I felt the urge to cast a bright light on those creatures of the night as we would share a common faith (or systematic oppression). I suppose we are a fragmented community – once a month – when the moon shines the strongest – we bring death & despair to the ones that marginalized our spirits.",2020-05-25T13:28:13Z,78,https://soundcloud.com/lespoints/sets/lespoints016-louh-moon-child-ep,7,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1058038084,4080776,"827623537,827623522,827623504,827623486,827623468",5,25:06,2020-05-25T13:20:38.000Z,1 year ago

In Post-Heretic Dracula X Chronicles II the Dracula figure functions as a part fictive and part autobiographical metaphor. Dracula mirrors certain systematic (therefore also internal) conditionings and attributes in its whole ambivalent fluctuations. This character represents the complex relationships of a loving/living person in a neo-liberal capitalist system while oscillating between melancholia & rage, facing the preservation or loss of his love and standing in an alienated position towards the ruling order. The eleven featured compositions and their respective song names (both of them are riddled with references) playfully touch on conflicts between love, life and system-critique, without being too upfront about the subject-matter.",2021-03-03T01:04:52Z,91,https://soundcloud.com/lespoints/sets/lp017-nicola-kazimir-post-heretic-dracula-x-chronicles-ii,5,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1200728332,4080776,"972310543,972310522,972310498,972310462,972310447,972310423,972310393,972310375,972310351,972310330,972310288",11,34:52,2021-02-15T08:07:47.000Z,8 months ago

Hoopski is next up on Baroque, with a couple of dark melodic cuts.

Pertinacious moves off with a clean drum led opening as swathes of bass &amp; dirty synths surround the groove, while uplifting pads &amp; rapid melody lines lift this one around the breakdown

Tireless sets the tone with a deep rumbling drive &amp; simple synth hots, as a slowly creeping top line moves in for an exhilarating lift to the breakdown.

""Outta Glasgow, S-Type rocks up a cracking debut EP of taut, hip hop on LuckyMe. S-Type has been a part of the catalytic Scottish hip hop scene for the best part of a decade, sharing demos with peers Hudson Mohawke and Rustie, while honing a potent, colourful sound of his own. Apparently the American R&B and hip hop execs are already knocking on his door, and it's no wonder when you've heard the beats on his 'Billboard EP'. From the top it's a powerful display of aptitude, bursting in with the polychromatic fireworks of 'Billboard' and the knock-out MPC hits of 'Flyp City', while 'Sensi Star' fires ultrafunked arpeggios and tender piano keys from the hip. He's at his most brash on 'Walrus' with its wailing talkbox and ecstatic harmonics, but our favourite has to be the low-riding 808 bomb 'Whole Lotta' or the Araabmuzik-meets-James Ferraro-style ebullience of 'You Da Best'."" - Boomkat Review

This 3 tracker was created with mayhem in mind. The 2 originals from Dino Maggiorana were made to move big crowds and cause serious damage on the dancefloor. 
Characterised by his unique sound signature, Dino's work on this EP is remarkable. 
Power, speed, depth and unique sound are the main ingredients combined to make an incredible atmosphere destined to rock any club to its core!

ANNA V.'s remix is simply incredible!

The Italian producer has taken every tension element from the original and brought them to new heights, making the remix faster, sturdier and more unexpected, underlined by her passion for hardware synthesizers and of course, her classic earthquake like kick drums!

This is a release that's going to make some serious damage!

203769516,Generation Bass,Center Of The Universe - Never mind the böreks,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000150275766-2wsfl3-large.jpg,"Norwegian artist Center of the Universe aka Jørgen Skjulstads has been on the Generation Bass radar for a few years now. Center of the Universe does a unique brand of quirky electronica that takes in all manner of things. His releases contain traditional songs remade alongside original compositions inspired by archaic entertainment consoles and pre-iPhone computer culture ranging from Azeri Skip, Post-Reggaeton, BalkanBit, Oriental Dub, Arabic Skweee, Balkan Skweee through to Post-Rembetika amongst many other things. 

For Generation Bass he has dropped this free Arabic Skweee/Oriental Dub/Greek/Turkish EP which he calls “Never mind the böreks”.  This EP consists of 4 tracks.  Following our short preface, C.O.U. tells us about the tracks in his own words:

1. Sigara Böreği 

This track has a very Kraftwerk vibe about it in terms of tempo and melody.

“This started out as a remix for Oslo avant-rockers Moon Relay. First I sang upon their guitars and added a lot of instruments for their remix. Then I wanted to do a break-dance-version of that remix and in the process everything except some ring modulated synths and the beat was gone out in favour of some more oriental vibes. The track is heavily inspired by Swedish Skweee-pioneer and Dj Daniel Savio.”

2. Black Feta

This is an epic track and we love the way that it builds up to that nastier wobble section. It's got an air of Oum Kalthoum about it, that epic, lengthy, big Egyptian sound.

“A few years ago I made a bootleg of the Bendaly family ""Do you love me?"" I wanted to do a similar track but without sampling someone. For this I recorded some oud, some synths and a cimbalon and tried to edit them into an oriental dub-mix.”

3. Songs of Today

At first, we thought this was a Balkan track, Serbian or Bosnian, surprised when we found it was Greek. It’s got a Trap vibe about it and is a great opener for a DJ set.  Sounds like a contemporary urban version of a track from a good time musical soundtrack.

“This song started with a sample from a Greek old record bought at a flea-marked. There are only Greek letters on it except of the title ""Songs of today"" I got a Greek friend to translate the words and it is a nice love song.

Chorus goes like: (get out my delalis* and agas** in
sejiani***) * Turkish word for the man that used to shout the news on the streets ** Turkish word for the prince *** serjiani = relaxing by looking at the horizon without doing anything. 

Pretty lyrical innit!”

4. The Power of Börek

This reminds us 50 Cent.  A very melodic track with an awesome DnB section.  

”This song is named after a home-made semi-modular synth called the Börek energy, which provides the bass-line for the track. It is homage to US producer Lazercrotch that made a lot of nice music a bit similar to this”.

5. Sigara Böreği (Streamer’s Late Night Take-Away Remix)

A bonus remix by our friend Streamer (“Walking with Camels” EP on GB) takes C.O.U. into 90’s Madchester territory with a bumpy, groovy 'twistin’ my melons man' mood!

His pastoral calling is marked by empathetic and passionate shepherd-ship and the love of God. Taught in some of the most powerful colleges in Southern Africa as well as UK. Currently lives in UK where he came as a missionary. He is currently the senior pastor of a ministry and a bible college.

Being a father of five children and five grand children, he has managed to put much of the things he taught into practice. As a result, he has taken some of that very experience into one of the books he wrote called, ""OVERCOMING THE CURVE OF IGNORANCE."" He acts as the man telling the story of his life as a new parent in this first part a series of three books. With great passion for children, he is still working with parents. His passion is to help parents to raise up their children to be successful intellectually, spiritually and to be responsible citizens. 

His experience with the parenting lessons and issues started as he ministered in church as a child evangelism teacher. Later became a great influential leader in the establishing of the group that deals with children of all ages and including the pre-teens which is so popular in Africa and other parts of the world. He saw great transformation of many young people of that age from bad behaviors to great and good ones. He traveled extensively teaching the Word of God and leading workshops on parenting as well as giving Christian life lessons to the young people and old.",2014-12-03T12:53:17Z,1,https://soundcloud.com/zimonline-radio-shows/sets/inspired-parenting-with-pastor-elasto-marume,0,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/62188577,7590907,,0,4:07:10,2014-12-03T12:52:08.000Z,7 years ago

Support: https://www.beatport.com/release/my-body-saying-let-go/2055013 
Jozef Kugler provides a couple of cuts here for Baroque.. 

the vocal tinged 'My body saying let go, is a smooth as silk concoction, of warm bass , subtle percs and trippy smooth vocal rides.

'Keep it on' is a chunkier uplifting affair with bouncy beats and a percy bassline, with male vox fx

Like swans, drinking only pure nectar of blossoming lotus, the liberated souls drink only from the spring of transcendental love. Mantra meditation is the door to another world, the world of pure love, harmony and true happiness. This world is not a geographical place, it’s a state of consciousness. No need to try to get there by your own strength, you can travel on a safe ship of ancient mantras.

192172709,Generation Bass,JayPross X 2PeKes - Zourney,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000145601076-9vn3e8-large.jpg,"Following his previous releases on Generation Bass Digital as part of DZC Crew, the time has come for Portuguese Bass Underground artist 2Pekes to branch out on his own for his next release on our imprint. However, he is not completely alone as he enlists the services of fellow Portuguese producer JayPross to deliver the ear catching melodies on this new tune named “Zourney”.

This new track keeps all of the hallmarks of the recognisable 2Pekes journey sound, a dark, unrelieved tension that makes you expect a breakdown or drop any second, which never comes but keeps you on your toes with its slow kick drums and double time percussion. With bleeping, thin, whiny synths and a beautiful percussion layer, this is another beautifully understated #FutureTarraxo track from one of the leaders of the New Wave of Portuguese Bass.

Foi composta para meu show “Como mudar o mundo?” que estreou em março de 2013 no Rio. Lancei uma versão gratuita só com violão e voz na internet e foi dessa forma que passei a executá-la na turnê. Em junho do mesmo ano, com as manifestações tomando as ruas do Brasil, ganhou clipe com imagens desses dias históricos que teve mais de 500.000 visualizações. 

Agora lanço um single digital com 6 versões: a original, 4 outras produzidas e tocadas por músicos que participaram de um concurso de arranjo no meu site e essa mais recente com a participação especial de Humberto Effe dos Picassos Falsos e do Furacão de Bolso, banda que me acompanha há muitos anos e que é composta por Lourenço Monteiro (bateria e produção da faixa), Gustavo Corsi (guitarras) e Andrea Spada (baixo). O clima é mais rock e mais psicodélico do que se poderia esperar da versão inicial. Ao final da canção uma jam no estúdio acabou gerando a instrumental “A dança”.",2014-07-02T17:02:24Z,59,https://soundcloud.com/leoni_a_jato/sets/as-coisas-nao-caem-do-ceu,9,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/42143500,213960,"156931263,156932065,156932145,156932186,156928608,156971308",6,25:46,2014-07-02T03:39:33.000Z,7 years ago

Elektronische Sequenz Proleten is the new project of Nicola Kazimir and Walid El Barbir -both are integral members of the Les Points collective based in Zürich. The Heart Of A Man, The Desire Of A Monster EP is their debut release under this moniker and balances somewhere between genre bending Acid-Techno and EBM.

178054981,Generation Bass,Streamer : Walking With Camels EP,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000140561357-iwifjz-large.jpg,"Streamer: Walking With Camels EP

All tracks by Streamer. Feat:
Tracks 1 & 3 Aleksandar Grujic (Keys from Serbia )
Tracks 1 & 3 Christoph Scherbaum (Guitars from Switzerland)
Track 1 Yrjänä Rankka (Bass from Finland)
Artwork: Steve Green

For this EP, Streamer has taken a leaf from the book of famous French composer Maurice Jarre who scored orchestral soundtracks with a Middle Eastern vibe for world famous movies like “Lawrence of Arabia” and “The man who would be King”. 

Streamer takes the blueprint from the soundtracks of such movies to create an EP filled with nostalgia from the era of yesteryear but with a modern Psychedelic Orchestral Dub blend fitting for today.  Over the 5 tracks, Streamer scores a sonic, cinematic Desert Wave soundtrack for an imagined movie yet to be made.  You can feel the dust and the heat emanating from the desert where the nomads wander searching for the meaning of life.  Here, life is simple but complex, harder yet easier and brutal but beautiful and Streamer’s soundtrack underscores all of this.  

Have a Happy Middle Eastern Christmas!

1179491758,TLRHub,Rethinking Democracy Podcast,,"Rethinking Democracy is a series of three audio podcasts between Dr Elspeth Payne, Beate Schuler Research Fellow at the Trinity Long Room Hub and a number of key panellists from the ‘Rethinking Democracy Democracy in an Age of Pandemics’ webinar series organised in spring 2020 in partnership with the Society of Fellows and Heyman Center for the Humanities at Columbia University.

These new podcasts allow listeners to re-engage with questions around the pandemic and democracy explored through the original series, find out what has happened since the series ended and, as we come to the end of 2020 and witness the first inoculations against Covid-19, ask where we might be going next?  

The podcasts were recorded in November and December 2020.

648380265,Rocket Recordings,Gum Takes Tooth - Borrowed Lies (Radio Edit),https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000443749860-s2abtg-large.jpg,"Gum Takes Tooth, the London duo of Jussi Brightmore and drummer Tom Fug unique approach whereby manipulated drum-triggered electronics achieve a dynamic, rhythmically driven and flagrantly unclassifiable fury that flirts with both speaker-ripping psych-rock pyrotechnics and synapse-shredding acid house delivered avoiding any of the trappings or clichés of either. 

Borrowed Lies (Radio Edit), the second track to be released from bands debut Rocket album ‘Arrow’ is a three and a half minute rhythmically driven stomp like a heavy strobing LCD Soundsystem from the future. 

“It concerns the small change victories and comforts our culture portions out to us to placate us and prevent action towards change - the lie of self-empowerment and paranoia is the ‘weapon offered as a gift’”elucidates Jussi the bands singer. “It ends with a call to arms to look inward to find the weapon to overcome this”.

The stunning b-side of this single is a ‘rework’ of Borrowed Lies by Italian astral-voyaging collective Lay Llamas. Led by Nicola Giunta, he has masterly produced an afrofuzz cosmic funk rework as a travelogue powered by a pan-global tribal fascination with rhythmic hypnosis and an unquenchable experimental mindset. 

The track centres around an addictive percussive groove and climaxes with a heavily overdriven fuzzed organ that create a psychedelic mantra in the vein of some of the early 1970’s tracks from Ethiopiques series albums.

Gum Takes Tooth are mavericks to the last, perpetual square-pegs and a band intent on forging onward to break all or any paradigms before them, creating a collection of kinetic anthems to battle everyday oppression - a work of machine-driven mania with its very human heart on its sleeve

Mantras, or transcendental sounds, have great power. They descend to us from the spiritual realm throught a line of perfect masters. Mantras free a person from anxiety and cultivate love in one’s heart. Just by associating with these spiritual sounds we receive wonderful benefit.

German born Gerardo Cinquegrana aka Tali Freaks now resides in Italy where he produces most of his music.

Gerardo studied piano for 4 years and rose to prominence on the club scene in Capri, having enjoyed a number of releases on label such as Sintope, Bonzai, Be As One, Wasabi &amp; of Course Baroque under various guises (  Tali Freaks, Aspecto, She's Super, Capri Delight, Gerardo, Highland Skies, J Hard and Tirrenia Vibe )

This second LP ( aftre his first album rleased on Bonzai ) reflects perfectly the blend of Gerardo's habitual origins, taking elements from the German electronic scene and fusing them with uplifting melodic vibes reflecting his home in Capri, Italy.

If ever there was a more perfect album to carry the hazy beach vibes into early evening Balearic beats, we are yet to hear it...

Track list:
1. Starburst Poem
2. Again and Again
3. Over and Over

With a string of successful releases already in their discography, Digitaria are no amateurs when it comes to creating memorable and unique dance floor hits. After putting out albums on both Hot Creations and International DJ Gigolos, the duo make their debut on Items & Things with the expertly crafted and undeniably authentic, 'Starburst Poems'.

Jumping off is the title track: A hypnotizing blend of spooky triplets laid over a rugged 'four to the floor' kick drum. As the wobbly lead constantly twists and turns, short sonic blasts of digital artifacts create the perfect contrast between organic euphoria and technological precision.

As with the title track, 'Again and Again' follows suit with a master combination of the natural and synthetic as the duo entwines a rich looping piano with seductive sine tones creating the perfect balance between polar opposites. All the while a haunting female vocal recites the track title resulting in an emotionally enchanting ride.

Wrapping up the EP is 'Over and Over‘, and again the duo create a uniquely magical odyssey by having opposing forces meet head-on. While rigid percussion constructs the foundation, wild arpeggios come to life establishing a strange, yet engaging campaign that fits superbly to any time and place.

We here at Items & Things couldn't be more satisfied, and it is with great pleasure and excitement that we welcome Digitaria to the Items & Things roster. Enjoy!

I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do
Cannot fuck wit you, you don’t have enough to do
I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do

I don’t got the time to be around no people fakin’
I’m bout my English muffins need that extra crispy bacon
Devils after my blessings they don’t want me to make it
Can’t be complacent, so motivated I gotta make it
Fuck being patient, tomorrow’s not promised I’m just sayin’ 
Picture me flossin’, Nostradamus I called it
Damn it feels awesome, when you makin’ deposits 
I got that flow runny faucets young legend takin’ no losses my nigga

Listen, I’m different, you cannot get a visit
I’m busy, I’m busy, I gotta make my livin’
The shit you on does not impress me
Too focused now can’t let you stress me bout my blessings nigga

I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do
I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do
Cannot fuck wit you, you don’t have enough to do
I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do

People always talkin’ bout shit that they bout to do
But don’t do it when you do it that’s when they get mad at you
Makes no difference I’m still good I fill my plate I’m feelin’ great
You do not exist to me there’s too much money in the way
And I can’t apologize I got the top spot on my mind
No we cannot fraternize unless you payin’ for my time
If we really talkin’ business I need all of it up front
If you only brought me bitches then there’s no more to discuss my nigga

I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do
I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do
Cannot fuck wit you, you don’t have enough to do
I got shit to do, nigga I got shit to do

Shutker lands back at Baroque with two superb singles, of equally large proportions!

Long Night sets the pace from the off, with a rocking bassline , and a tweakin synth line that slides in and takes over the room, opening out intio the breakdown , to epic effect, it then teases &amp; twirls for a hypno beast of a tune!

If you like your tones to more of a techno slant, then Phase is for you, A repetitive slammin groove, minimal melodies but pristine productiuon &amp; trippy undretones.

Ranging from conditions for ordination itself to the challenges and promise of global digital communication, Parami brings all her experience and good humour to bear as she sketches out what a healthy Buddhist sangha can be, and can contribute to the planet and to the welfare of all human beings. 

This is a profoundly engaging, affirming and realistic survey of the needs of any community where trying to understand the nature of things, and seeking to be of use in the world as part of doing so, is at the forefront of people’s concern. 

Talk given at Chintamani Retreat Center, Mexico, October 2019.

Parami's Personal Wishlist for the next 20 years
1. As individuals, and as an Order and community, we make peace and learn to hold complexity.

2. To find ways of creating real communities that are alternatives and open (no prescribed view of what they might look like). 

3. To strengthen local “Areas” of Triratna by having strong Area Council where the Order, Movement and College are strongly represented; and that some of the people taking part then come together in an international meeting.

4. That we really embrace digital technology.

5. That we build a culture of spiritual friendship (kalyana mitrata) that includes Restorative Process.

6. That someone lay out clearly the principles around practices that conduce to “Real” Going for Refuge - seeing into the nature of reality in a way that can’t be lost sight of.

7. Creative, skilful succession planning.

8. Ordain more young people.

9. Strengthen the International Council meeting, and clarify the relationship between that and the College of Public Preceptors.

10. May we continue as a force in the world, with more diversity and more unity.",2019-12-24T16:34:13Z,2,https://soundcloud.com/freebuddhistaudio/sets/paramis-personal-wishlist-20-years,1,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/951848425,2707765,"733477066,733477063,733477048,733477039,733477021,733477012,733476985,733476967,733476955,733476931",10,1:04:35,2019-12-24T16:32:04.000Z,1 year ago

171932859,Generation Bass,Neki - AK-47,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000138369262-g4sn96-large.jpg,"In Serbia, there is a custom of firing manual weapons in the air as a gesture of extreme happiness - like birth of a child or marriage. 

These weapaons can be guns, pistols or machine guns -  AK-47 is quite common in Serbia because one version of that weapon is actually made in Serbia. 

So Neki took that machine gun sample and played it at every gig either as Neki or ShazaLaKazoo - in his moments of extreme happiness. After he had used the sample a billion of times live - he decided to pay tribute to that sample and made a track around it - with synths and snares resembling it and this is it.

Featuring remixes by America's Bad Ass Bass Guru Banginclude and a South African Post-Apocalyptic banger by Maramza.

Scripted and hosted by Dr Alana Osbourne (Université Libre de Bruxelles), the podcasts emerge from two sessions hosted by the Urban Lab and curated by Prof Jennifer Robinson (UCL) in 2019, as part of an international conference exploring emerging themes and critical methodologies at the frontiers of urban theory and practice. 

The podcast series was co-ordinated by Dr Clare Melhuish (UCL), produced by Deborah Shorindé for Whistledown Productions, and supported by Dr Kamna Patel, former Bartlett Vice-Dean for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.

Mantras, or transcendental sounds, have great power. They descend to us from the spiritual realm throught a line of perfect masters. Mantras free a person from anxiety and cultivate love in one’s heart. Just by associating with these spiritual sounds we receive wonderful benefit.

Seta Label : Hazner - Afrikaanse Wortels (SET228)

Another gem landed to our little base called Seta, this time from Italy! Mr. Dario Assenzo Hazner, one of the winners of the famous 8bit Records label's competition on Gorge's ""Erotic Soul"" delivered a house bomb called ""Afrikaanse Wortels"". As the name implies the Dutch roots (Wortels) of the Afrikaans language are reflected in the vocal and overall in the atmosphere of track. Shiny chords and melodies accompanied by a dynamic bassline make this piece a feel-good listening experience. Big shout-out to the remixers, namely the Italian duo Sonic Dust and the Slovak trio Sensoreal, who created excellent variations of the original in their specific style.",2021-04-26T13:00:40Z,4,https://soundcloud.com/setalabel/sets/hazner-afrikaanse-wortels,1,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1248216628,3866254,"1036959643,1036959628,1036959616",3,13:58,2021-04-26T12:54:53.000Z,6 months ago

For our birthday, we chose the Italian born and raised Sisko Electrofanatik & Klaark and their 'Hyperion' single. This is a dark and melodic track produced with a festival scent on it. Built around a gigantic acid bassline and a distinctive percussive signature, it is an original worth trying in big stages or where the crowds can be difficult to move/ 
Massive, dark and melodic, groovy, yet sturdy and strict, it resembles VOLTAGE's music sound signature in the best possible way. 

Steve Mulder's remix is a blast! Speedy, intense and with various elements of the classic techno tracks of the 90's. The Dutch producer is definitely giving his own approach to the original, creating a 5AM track impossible for the floor to resist!

Yan Oxygen's remix is darker, crisper and boosted with organic sound elements as well as clever pads and drones creating a more 'improv' result ideal for peak time! the Ukrainian producer really outdid himself on this one!

VOLTAGE Records releases the fourth edition of “The Armory”
featuring tracks that will push your set to the next dimension.


After a year from its previous release, the fourth edition of “The Armory” is back and this time it’s focused on deviant tracks that will shine in the most important time of the gig: 05:00 AM.
 
We’re proud to feature music from Artists that are already known for their distinctive musical signatures such as ANNA V., Dino Maggiorana, M.I.T.A., Yan Oxygen, David Bau and of course tracks from globally rising producers like Mintech, Richard Cleber, Beck And Rius, Sacred Lines and Ucros.  
 
Picked among countless submissions, each and every original in this album is com- pletely different and created with one thing in mind: to boost the flow of your set to a whole new level and make the crowd dance.
Compiled and distilled with love for Techno, the fourth edition of the Armory contains music for almost every taste: Acid elements, borderline Trancy or full on Techno, it’s vir- tually impossible to not have a favourite inside this collection.
This is the 4th edition of “The Armory” Series of Compilations. All originals have never been released before.

But fuck all that, just give it a listen and hear for yourself.

No doubt that ""Beautiful Nightmare"" is a high quality music production from all aspects. The melodic and intricate bassline with some nu-disco influence calls immediately to dance and those warm pads, chords and vocals make pleasing warm feeling in our hearts and bodies. This all is rounded out with a professional mixing technique, which adds some fullness and clarity to the whole package. Our long-time (label) friend DJ M4SH a.k.a.

This is not the bubbly chiptune you've heard before. Spanning the whole gamut of despair, anxiety, and cynical optimism, all fished from the ever-advancing technological trash heap. Armed with an Atari ST on one hand, and a Commodore Amiga in the other, DF0:Bad is rampaging towards the future with a murderous glee. Ripping and tearing through hopelessness, to find value and meaning what's relegated as redundant.

So rare is it that you discover a band with such an original sound, coming from somewhere within their own universe that when you do find a band such as this, it’s always surprising. We proudly introduce you to Next Life.

Hailing from Oslo, Norway Next Life are Hai Nguyen Dinh and Tormod Christensen. They make music that fetishistic ally explores the twin worlds of Deathmetal and game music with a preciousness that some how skirts into the art-rock realm. Around the office, we call their sound “Gameboy Deathmetal” and when you hear a second of the record, you’ll know why.

Basically it’s real guitar, synth guitar, Nintendo “vocals” and programmed beats made to fit a metal archetype. This refined and personal new music somehow always winks at the artifice through which it was created (which is why it is also completely unnerdy).

Lastly, a side note here about Next Life. These guys fucking ROCK live. You wouldn’t believe it could work, but live they are like vicious robots spasmodically jerking to every power chord and chugging riff. They are available for booking, and really, they are probably one of the very best new bands around.",2014-11-09T02:00:27Z,5,https://soundcloud.com/cock-rock-disco-label/sets/next-life-electric-violence,0,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/58569659,121856969,"176016828,176016827,176016825,176016823,176016820,176016817,176016814,176016811,176016809,176016806,176016803,176016802,176016799,176016798",14,27:35,2014-11-09T02:00:25.000Z,7 years ago
214205605,Generation Bass,Streamer - Walking with Camels Remixed,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000157563966-oh9mh0-large.jpg,"We return with Streamer and a Remix EP focusing on his “Walking with Camels” EP which we released last Christmas.  We loved that EP so much that we just needed a follow up and what better way than to get a bunch of our favourite producers to put a twist on the EP. 

The original Walking with Camels sounds like a precious, classic and unmissable (they don’t make it like they used to) 70s recording featuring some tracks in the tricky measures of 6/8 and 5/8.  

In parts, the EP sounded like the lost Middle Eastern Jazz recordings of Idris Mohammed, Byrd and M Jarre jamming together on a modern electronic Psychedelic Orchestral Dub tip… a sonic, cinematic Desert Wave soundtrack for an imaginary movie yet to be made – https://soundcloud.com/generation-bass-1/sets/streamer-walking-with-camels

For the Remixes EP, this world was turned upside down and inside out, deconstructed and reconstructed for the club environment. Most of the remixers opted for Last Sacrifice as the track to remix.  It is a track that gets under your skin and refuses to leave and there never seems to be enough of it, always leaving you yearning for more

The 12 tracks on the Ep/Album feature an array of genre styles from current hot fave Gqom (Gome) through to 80’s Synthwave, Grime, Tribal, Vogue/Ballroom, Techno, Wobble, Neuro Funk, DnB, Acid, Jungle and Skweee.

Track 1 
Streamer turns the EP Title track into a Vogue/Ballroom Bass blitz in the desert. Arab Ha! never sounded quite like this before demonstrating that Streamer is a true Master At Work!

Track 2
Bandish Projekt created a spine-tingling remix of The Last Sacrifice featuring Hindi vocals on a 5/8 Dubstep excursion.

Track 3
For his first remix of Searching for Ketama (there are 3 in all), Streamer looked to South African Gqom (Gome) for this remix. Commercial and accessible and already supported by BBC Radio 1 and Toddla T amongst others.

Track 4
Insane Fennel added to the ritual and gave The Last Sacrifice an Apocalyptic Wall of Bass Re-rub.

Track 5
Streamer, who it seems can turn his hand to almost any genre style and pull it off with aplomb, gave Midnight Express a Neuro-Funk, DnB, Jungle make-over turning it into something completely MAD!

Track 6
Sarantis turns The Last Sacrifice into a Grime epic

Track 7
Sanmon transformed the sacrificial ritual into a Techno behemoth

Track 8
Streamer’s 2nd remix of Searching for Ketama finds him giving it a Ketama Gold sheen with a harder hitting vibe, taking it way down to 80 BPM.

Track 9
Zhe Pechorin gives The Last Sacrifice a new deep-tribal, slow-grind make-over.

Track 10
Our friend Centre of the Universe was bold enough to tackle Bedouin producing an other-worldly remix that sounds like we could have landed on the moon, way before Neil Armstrong did!

Track 11
For streamer’s 3rd and final version of Ketama, he covered an idea I had in my mind for a Bladerunner version in the form of a DesertWave remix harking back to 80’s Synthwave sensibilities.  

Track 12
We close this Ep/Album with Drvg Cvltvre tapping into early Pink Floyd for inspiration combined with his affinity for Acid and he teases us with a slow bulding mellow monster.

Illuminati EP is consisted of 3 tracks, all combining intense melodic elements with dark groove, underlined by a solid rhythmical synthesis. This is the kind of modern techno that's rare to find. Long synth pads, high pitched leads and organic, almost breathing arpeggios are some of the elements that this EP was made. 
This 3 tracker is not to be missed!

Through a literature review, survey and a series of learning case workshops, the project will gather evidence from the experience of IDR stakeholders.

LA TERRA TREMA by Giovanni Verrina & Germano Ventura is a musical marriage of restless souls and naughty hearts on the shrine of repetitive illusions. La Terra Trema - like the rest of the tracks - have borrowed their names from films originating from time of Neorealism - an Italian cinematic movement, born during the postwar era of early 1950’s-1960’s. ""The neorealism was a time of cultural change and social progress in Italy, these films presented contemporary stories and ideas, free of any sort of agenda, but more of a reflection of the times we’re living. This approach comes through in our music - no judgement, just observation - without any influence or comparisons, without following any scheme - it just is."" - says Verrina. 
La Terra Trema contains 13 tracks from the darker side, straight to dancefloors. Filled by contemporary electronica, slight percussives layered on mid-tempo techno and house basics.",2016-08-11T11:25:00Z,54,https://soundcloud.com/allinnrecords/sets/verrina-ventura-la-terra-trema,5,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/16430880,679067,,0,30:32,2013-12-06T05:53:22.000Z,8 years ago

VOLTAGE Records welcomes Dutchmen #Rodrick and #Erich #Von #K. who join forces for their debut release on our label with their 'In Orbit' EP. 

Consisting of two completely different in scent, vibe and feel tracks, this is a pure main room production, creating a really unique EP, absolutely referring to big crowds. 

'In Orbit', first track of the EP is atmospheric and filled with dark groove. The smart vocal shots and the clever use of synth chords in the long breaks are enriched with solid and crystal-clear drums, making it a melodic approach to modern Techno making it a peak time tune destined to rock the floor with its intelligent elements. 

Second track of the EP, 'Platform goodbyes' is way more sentimental in nature. Vocal touches, subtle metal percussions and a solid bassline perfectly unite over smart auto filters and improvising arrangement tricks to create a moody, yet and massive atmosphere.

217413954,Generation Bass,Dj Doraemon - Apocalypse EP,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000158905604-j0ypli-large.jpg,"This artist from Portugal first caught our attention way back in about 2013 when he was about 15 years of age.  His productions range from Tarraxo, Afro Beat and Kuduro through to Kizomba. 

For this EP we’ve chosen some of his most brutal of tracks in a dark dystopian apocalyptic vein. 

When we first heard these tracks, they just blew our minds with their immense power and unique sound.  The tracks exhibit a raw, unpolished demo-like quality which we would not change for the world. They also demonstrate a maturity way beyond the 15 years of age of the producer when he made some of these tracks.  

The brutal beauty of these tracks is further mythologized by the fact that pre-masters or wavs just don’t exist anymore as Dj Doraemon’s computer crashed and he also did not back up any of his stuff.  

So we are left with just the unmastered MP3’s in 160kbps!  You must think we’re mad but this fact didn’t deter us from releasing this EP because this is essential music that needs to be heard and which we must have on our label regardless of quality and bit rate.  It also ties in with the way in which a lot of underground artists of African heritage actually drop their tracks without giving a f**k as to bit rate.  Now that might mean an epic fail on a great sound system but paradoxically this is the real deal in many ways!

Over the 5 tracks Dj Doraemon creates distorted polyrhythmic beats interspersed with gun shots, sirens, bells that toll for thee, animated voices, crash cymbals, screams, groans and static interference. There’s a naiveté and doom laden atmospherics to create bleak yet enthralling imagery.  

3 of the tracks belong to the Tarraxo genre whilst the latter 3 to Kuduro.  This is a name to watch out for in the future but we couldn’t wait and so here he is in all of his rawness!

BIO:
Dj Doraemon aka Ivan Lima is from Cova Da Moura, Lisboa, Portugal.  He is now 18 years of age but started producing at the age of 10 after he saw a friend working in FL Studio 4.  He feels he has developed his own style and vibe but also acknowledges that he so much more to learn.

858139445,all inn records,X,https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000589862894-z9r935-large.jpg,"All Inn Records celebrates 10 years at the top of their game here via a mind-blowing, 16 track compilation. Spread across 4x12 inches and split to two issues, the anniversary release features a host of label associates, old and new, as well as a range of exclusive tracks that show the breadth and depth of the vital label.

Transylvania born, Budapest-based label All Inn Records has championed numerous new and exciting artists over the last decade. It has specialized in not one specific style of music, just essential, forward-looking and easy-rolling club sounds with their own personality. Instead of looking back and re-releasing their classics, the label still points forward and focuses on present and future, by publishing characteristic mid-tempo gems from its most pivotal artists.       

This is a fantastic showcase of one of the most seminal labels over the last decade of the techno-house scene. All Inn Records - being the parent label of All Inn Black, All Inn Limited and Nilla - released nearly 80 records from 2009 till 2019. The loyalty of fans and followers, clubbers and DJ's kept the label strong even in the hardest times, making the label peerless and unforgettable by its evergreen pieces of vinyl. A label that’s left an inimitable mark on the electronic music, All Inn’s latest without doubt ensures that it goes with an absolute bang.",2019-08-30T13:47:07Z,174,https://soundcloud.com/allinnrecords/sets/allinnx,23,public,https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/858139445,679067,"673246175,673245896,673245515,673245062,673244792,673243844,673243418,673243082,673242767,673242434,673241930,673241666,673241396,673241165,673240925,673240565",16,48:06,2019-08-30T13:26:55.000Z,2 years ago

It’s changing, the worker searched for post-leftist solutions and got lost.
Nine circles applauded the proletariat and imagined how a community
could be congregated, while screams of violence would be filtered by boiling blood.
Exploiters of labor either find themselves rotting away in a never ending icy rain or are dragging their selfish accumulations on their chests for eternity -while the worker slowly identifies himself as a counter-commodity. Algorhythms (fraud) always mislead – once the worker gets past them only Dis will be awaiting her/him.
