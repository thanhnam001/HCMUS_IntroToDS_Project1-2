Salinger’s “Nine Stories” or Flannery O’Connor’s “Wise Blood” than with the usual lyrical slant of popular music. Bazan is a gifted storyteller, weaving parables of spiritual conflict, suburban ennui, and personal surrender into magnetic, well-crafted songs.
His debut solo full-length album, Curse Your Branches (out now on Barsuk), is a masterwork by a modern American poet at the height of his powers. Paste Magazine called him one of the “100 Best Living Songwriters”. This record is the deepest and most explicit exploration of his struggles with faith and a meditation on all things passed between the generations.",5405,1,24,,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:612849

In the past 7 years TAI went from being one of Germanys most acclaimed hip-hop producers to touring the globe and making a name in his own right as one of dance music's most prolific DJ & producers.
TAI’s discography includes an impressive and diverse list of collaborators, among them; Diplo, Watermat, Steve Aoki, Felix Da Housecat and Scott Storch.
His unique production skills have seen him release on tastemaker imprints such as Spinnin, Boys Noize, Dim Mak, Mixmash, Ultra, Doorn and Polydor (Universal). He's been personally requested to remix the likes of Sam Smith, Deorro, Kid Cudi, Steve Aoki, Peking Duk, The Bloody Beetroots and the Swanky Tunes among others.
On the live event front TAI’s completed several tours throughout Europe, Asia and Australia, making his mark with eclectic live sets, including performances at festivals such as world famous Tomorrowland (Belgium), Big City Beats (Germany), Beat Patrol (Austria), Future Music (Australia) and hundreds of clubs worldwide, among them renowned venues such as Pacha Ibiza, Privilege, Create L.A., Space And Bootshaus.
Looking onward in 2017: among several tours in the works, TAI is set to drop several follow up releases & remixes to his Beatport topping single ""Frequency"" with Watermät. His latest Armada Deep releases ""In & Out"" with the classic OnePhatDeeva vocal and ""Paradise"" have already worked their way into the House clubs from Ibiza to Miami to Australia as jacking house bangers.
One thing is for sure TAI’s following is growing rapidly and with a heightened anticipation for what’s to come next.

こんにちは、日本!!!
Here is where I'm supposed to put all the radio stations and big artists that support my work. Then I'm supposed use the following sentences to explain how I grew up and how that impacted the music I produce. After that, I'm supposed to put links to other stuff I do and my social media. Then I'm meant to thank you for joining me on my journey. The end.
I write what I write because it feels good to my ears and sometimes it makes other people's ears feel good too. :3

Playing four handed remains one of the sisters’ favourite activities.
Khatia’s extraordinary talent was recognized when she was very young. Aged six, she gave her début performance as soloist with an orchestra, and was subsequently invited to give guest performances in Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Russia, Israel and the USA.
Khatia prefers not to be regarded as a child prodigy: virtuosity for its own sake does not appeal to her. Above all, she embraces pianists from earlier generations such as Rachmaninoff, Richter and Gould. She admires her “favourite pianist”, Martha Argerich, for her uniqueness and, as a consequence, does not view Argerich as someone she should try to emulate. And since she regards herself as “wholly a person of the 20th century”, Khatia does not identify so much with pianists of today.
Khatia’s warm, sometimes sorrowful playing may reflect a close proximity to Georgian folk-music, which, she attests, has greatly influenced her musicality. Critics emphasize that her playing has an aura of elegant solitude and even melancholy, which she does not feel to be a negative attribute. “The piano is the blackest instrument,” she says, a “symbol of musical solitude”, which even a pianist must become accustomed to. “I have to be psychologically strong and forget the hall if I want to share it with the audience.”
During her studies at Tbilisi’s State Conservatoire, Khatia won a special prize at the Horowitz International Competition for Young Pianists in Kiev in 2003 as well as first prize at the Foundation to Assist Young Georgian Musicians competition set up by Elisabeth Leonskaya. At the 2003 Piano Competition in Tbilisi, she became acquainted with Oleg Maisenberg, who persuaded her to transfer to Vienna’s University of Music and Performing Arts. Winner of the Bronze Medal at the 12th Arthur Rubinstein Piano Master Competition in 2008, she was also distinguished as the Best Performer of a Chopin piece and as Audience Favourite.
Khatia Buniatishvili has given critically acclaimed solo recitals and chamber music concerts at such renowned venues as London’s Wigmore Hall, Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw and the Musikverein in Vienna. In 2008 she made her US concert début at Carnegie Hall (Zankel Hall), performing Chopin’s Second Piano Concerto.
A BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artist for 2009-2011, Khatia regularly collaborates with BBC orchestras. In 2010 she receiveda Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award and has been nominated by Vienna’s Musikverein and Konzerthaus as a Rising Star for
the 2011/2012 season.
Upcoming engagements will see Khatia Buniatishvili perform with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra , the Orchestre de Paris and the Munich Philharmonic with Paavo Järvi. Recitals will also take her to Berlin, Vienna, Amsterdam, Paris and the Wigmore Hall in London, with further appearances at, amongst other venues, the Verbier Festival, the Lucern Festival and the Schwetzinger Muisktage.
Khatia Buniatishvili is fluent in five languages and lives in Paris.",38094,0,40,,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:13902946

During a trip from Stuttgart, Germany, to the United States, Andreas Sannemann, a leading international audio imaging specialist and composer, and Oliver Klenk, audio production wunderkind and composer, were introduced to L.A. Radio Producer and Program Director Dave “Chachi” Denes. Their shared vision of radio’s future in the digital age led them to co-found Benztown, swiftly building a network of partners in the United States, Germany, England, Australia, and New Zealand.
In July 2010, the company grew further when Denes formed Benztown Radio Networks, an international media syndication company providing dynamic programming and features to radio stations and media companies around the world, including: The Todd N Tyler Radio Empire, Hot Mix, Sunday Night Slow Jams with R Dub!, Remote News Service, Vipology, Mr. Master, Tough Love with Siri, Ask Alexa, VS3 and Flashback.
Today, Benztown is an international radio imaging, production library, programming, podcasting, jingles, and voiceover services company, with offices in Los Angeles, New York, and Stuttgart, and over 2,300 affiliations on six continents. The company offers the highest quality imaging workparts for 23 libraries across 14 formats, including AC, Hot AC, CHR, Country, Urban, Rhythmic, Classic Hits, Rock, News/Talk, Sports, and JACK. Benztown’s industry-leading technology and proprietary Web-based imaging solution, Benztown Branding, is used daily by nearly 1,200 broadcast radio stations and digital services worldwide. Benztown also provides custom voiceover, jingle, and copywriting services.
Led by founders Andreas Sannemann, Chief Executive Officer, Dave “Chachi” Denes, President, and Oliver Klenk, Head of Production and Composition, the company’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed: Benztown has been recognized for the fifth consecutive year by Inc.

In the beginning, in 2007, Klangklinik was a loose collective, by now they consist of 7 musicians, surrounded by a variable circle of guest musicians, who get invited for private and public jam sessions. The visual artist EddiE haRA has contributed live painting as a part of Klangklinik in public performances. Klangklinik uses classic rock instruments but the sound remains experimental and is strictly improvised with a repetitive character. Sometimes psychedelic, sometimes noisy soundscapes and accidental songs are being woven out of the moment.

In a recent poll by Ipsos-Reid (April 2006) 62% of Canadians stated that they believed that “through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, God provided the way for the forgiveness of sins.” Unfortunately, the percentage of those that attend church doesn’t come anywhere near 62%. Just one in four Canadians attends church on a weekly basis. Just a generation ago most Canadians had at least some knowledge of the what was in the Bible, but with the increase in the secularization of Canadian society over the past three decades, Biblical illiteracy in on the rise. Even though Back to the Bible has been a part of Canadian life for over 50 years, its presence is more important then ever.
Facts:
• The Canadian Radio and Television Commission, the media regulating body for Canada, didn’t allow any Christian radio stations until 1988. Since then, dozens of new Christian radio stations have gone on the air, and many of them now carry the programs of Back to the Bible. As new Christian stations get up and running, more opportunities become available.
• The province of Quebec, the heart of French-speaking Canada, is the least evangelized region in all of North and South America. Less than 1% claim to be evangelicals. The need for French-speaking Bible teaching radio programs is great.
• Back to the Bible Canada spends $850,000 a year on buying radio time. Much more is needed to impact non-English speaking Canadians with the Gospel.",520,24,7,2,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:20227858

BIOGRAPHY:
Daniel Tompkins is an award winning and innovative British singer / songwriter from Nottinghamshire in The East Midlands. More widely recognised as the singer for TesseracT with his unique live performances and unmistakable dramatic soundscapes on the highly acclaimed albums ‘One’ and 'Polaris'. Since 2009 Daniel has established himself as a highly respected vocalist with a dedicated worldwide fan base. Arguably one of the busiest collaborative vocalists, Daniel’s voice has been celebrated as one of the best in modern progressive rock and metal.
Daniel has released a diverse catalogue of records to date and in doing so demonstrated a natural ability to marry his distinct voice to various genres and yet remain in mesmerising control of his audience. However, much more than a recording artist, he is an accomplished performer who has earned a host of awards and honours having toured the world, sharing the stage with artists such as Iron Maiden, Gojira, Lamb of God, Devin Townsend, Meshuggah, Senses Fail, Animals As Leaders, No Use For A Name, Periphery and Protest The Hero
Looking to the future Daniel now balances his time between TesseracT and White Moth Black Butterfly and his various collaborations continuing to create a strong impression within the music industry.
PEER AND PRESS QUOTES:
“Dan has a hell of a voice!!!” – DEVIN TOWNSEND
“Check out the awesome vocals of Dan Tompkins, the man can sing YEAH!!’ – JON GOMM
“The dramatic soundscapes Dan Tompkins creates really are on another level, standing above the current crop of vocalists out there. Tesseract are destined for great things with a frontman leading the charge like this…one of the best vocals in modern metal” – SCUZZ TV (UK)
“An exceptional album from (White Moth Black Butterfly) Dan Tompkins. An absolutely essential work. Experimental, accessible and quite brilliant. This ranks high amongst this year’s progressive releases.” – Classic Rock Presents Prog Magazine
“There are so many musicians out there who jump from genre to genre and experiment with different kinds of sound but not all of them are able to pull it off. Out there, a bunch of them have the ability to make things so awkward, you’d just want to question what they were thinking. But then again, there are the special ones, the ones who shine in the dark and shine even brighter against the sun. The One’s who fully understand and are able to control their capabilities and of course the ones who actually know how to take things to the next level. They have this gift in whatever they do, it just works. One man who’s got this gift is UK-based vocalist, Daniel Tompkins – PULP MAGAZINE (MANILA)",8906,14,29,66,34,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:2938130

UK Funky was emerging, influenced by the Soulful, Funky House and broken beats that Pioneer was playing at the time.

It's made a heap of friends and won many fans along the way, and been lavished with praise pretty much everywhere they write about music. Example: Rolling Stone magazine called it ""The hippest long weekend on the annual music-festival calendar.""
Some of the world's most exciting artists have performed there, too. The Shins, The Rapture, TV On The Radio, Florence and the Machine, Klaxons, Hot Chip, Flaming Lips, Wolf Parade, Bloc Party and Fatboy Slim have made the short hop from Europe or North America to share the stages with Iceland's finest talents, including bands such as Sigur Rós, FM Belfast, GusGus, múm, Singapore Sling and Dr Spock, to name but a few. And when the live bands have done their thing, top DJs from all over the world spin across the city until the crack of dawn.
But there's more to Airwaves than music. Reykjavík is quite possibly the perfect festival city – small enough to be welcoming, sophisticated enough to offer cultural, historical and nightlife diversions to rival cities ten times its size. Maybe twenty. Who knows? And it's surrounded by some of the most unique and astonishing natural beauty you're ever likely to see (this is a grand statement, but you should just see it).
Roll out of bed, hose the party remains out of your hair and hop on a bus. Before you can remember what you did the night before, you're looking at geysers, waterfalls, lava fields – all the best that a volcanic island has to offer, including the world-famous Blue Lagoon, favorite soaking spot of the international hung-over glitterati. Mmm! You can really taste the hipster!",8284,144,39,,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:4046419

Seta Label was founded in 2008 Slovak DJs and producers named Funkatron. Initially, the label was mainly focused on techno and minimal. After Chris Florio and Keče (Sensoreal) took over the leadership in 2010, the label has been gradually transformed into its present form and deep house and tech house started to play the leading role. Nevertheless, also other subgenres of electronic club music can be occasionally heard among the releases. Apart from the musical genre the tracks signed to Seta label are mostly deep, groovy, organic and/or emotional pieces produced by artists coming from different parts of the world.

Tudo começou em Novembro de 2006 com algumas gravações no computador que até então foram elogiadas apenas por amigos, fazendo com que os garotos começassem a levar isso a sério.
Temas como mulheres, diversão, “noitadas”, namoros são o principal assunto cantado
pelos dois jovens.Por fim, a pedido de muitos, decidiram gravar suas músicas de forma mais profissional para seguirem carreira num mundo já habitado pelos bem sucedidos Mc's Fox e Mãe que foram os criadores do estilo “Stronda Music”.
A divulgação do grupo até hoje ocorre praticamente 100% pela internet, que foi o meio pelo qual o sucesso veio à tona. Hoje o sucesso tomou proporções inimagináveis e a cada dia se superam atingindo um público cada vez mais variado e distante de Cidade onde tudo começou.
No início, os dois jovens adolescentes colocavam batidas de rappers americanos, adaptando suas letras expressivas e excitantes formando o estilo "" Stronda Music "" , mas hoje, possuem batidas e estilo próprios.
As músicas que mais se destacam no grupo são hits como ""Nossa Química"" ,""XXT"", ""Mansão Thug Stronda"" , “Playsson Raiz” e “Tic Tic Nervoso” que é uma regravação e está na trilha da novela MALHAÇÃO ID na Rede Globo.
A música que mais se destacou e abalou estruturas de várias casas noturnas e matinês foi “Nossa Química” , que hoje é uma das músicas mais tocadas nas Rádios do Brasil todo.Sua antiga versão possui mais de 5 milhões de visualizações no youtube.
Os dados não param por aí a comunidade do Orkut já passou dos 150 mil membros e o recente videoclipe “Mansão Thug Stronda” com participação de Mr.Catra tem mais de 1 milhão de visualizações em menos de 1 mês de lançamento.
Em Agosto de 2009 lançaram seu CD Nova Era da Stronda , pela gravadora Galerão Records e alcançaram a marca de 80 mil downloads.
O Bonde da Stronda já passou por vários lugares consagrados como Citibank Hall no maior evento jovem do Rio de Janeiro, pelas matinês mais bombadas de todos os tempos, eventos bombásticos como ""Pepsi Rio Festival"" , entre outros.
Fique ligado, pois estes meninos são uma grande promessa e ainda vai dar muito o que falar, construindo uma extensa carreira pelo Brasil. Aguardem!",24991,4,40,1,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:2899676

""Being at an Albion gig is like entering a bedouin tent and for the first time ever smell the scent of an exotic spice that you could imagine living with for the rest of your life.""
He is a DJ who doesn't merely take you on another drum journey, but adds an extra dimension where preconception doesn't apply. It can take a while to get used to it though. Because sophistication never went out of style, it just took more than three decades to catch up with it. And when the coin finally dropped, Albion was there to pick it up. In 2004 he realized that he could set out on a musical journey that no DJ had done before him. Over the last years he has recorded more than a hundred mixes and has steadily built up a worldwide following.
With the groundbreaking Mixtura mixes, he rediscovered and brought together European disco tracks that had been lost and forgotten since the heydays, Albion defined his own sound, which he refers to as Continental Disco Sound.
So far, he has been putting dance floors on fire in Amsterdam, Athen, Barcelona, Belgrad, Berlin, Bordeaux, Bristol, Bruxelles, Chemnitz, København, Dresden, Dublin, Göteborg, Hague, Helsinki, Leeds, Leipzig, London, Lyon, Madrid, Malmö, Mons, München, Mockba, New York, Oslo, Palma de Mallorca, Paris, Pescara, Rotterdam, Sofia, Stockholm, Thessaloniki, Turku, Uzés, Veliko Tarnovo and Vilnius.
Each year Albion with friends arrange the disco festival Camp Cosmic.

From Trini soca and Brazilian baile funk to French afro-trap, South African gqom and the new wave of UK funky; all these different scenes, sounds, they’re thriving. We want to connect the dots between them, bridge the gaps, bring everything together, with our productions, DJ sets and, ultimately, live band.”
Global thinking comes naturally to Jus Now. In the half decade since Trinidadian producer Lazerbeam and UK beat-smith Interface met on a dark Bristol dancefloor, cross-continental collaboration has been at the very heart of everything they’ve done.
Separated by 5,000 miles of Atlantic ocean with deeply disparate upbringings and musical influences, but united by a love of percussion, rhythm, bass and a damn good party, Jus Now’s music could never have been anything but utterly unique.
While at first the duo may have struggled to place their genre-shirking sounds, or even find enough music to play alongside their own in DJ sets; these days it seems the rest of the planet is finally catching up with what Jus Now have been doing since day one.
Alongside their production work for many of Caribbean’s biggest superstars - including the smash hit ‘Big Bad Soca’ for Trinidad’s Bunji Garlin and ‘Fire (Spotie)’ with Jamaica’s Busy Signal - Jus Now have been busy in their new London studio working on fresh, globally infused UK rhythms and collaborating with the likes of Dismantle, Champion and Brazilian producers A.MA.SSA.
Although now signed to Warner music and with previous releases on premium independent imprints such as Gutterfunk, Digital Soundboy and 3beat, their latest EP, ‘Accents’ is a self-released project available exclusively via Bandcamp.
The EP packs six powerful, club-ready tracks that, in typical Jus Now style, draw influence from everywhere from Port of Spain to Paris. Bassy, bashy and ridden with rhythm, the tracks are inspired by the duo’s global travels and own unique sets of influence. Fusing classic Bristol D&B b-lines with off-kilter Brazilian drums; clattering Kuduro cadences with hypnotic techno grooves and lolloping Libyan rhythms with pitch-stretching synths; like everything they do, ‘Accents’ is as unique as it is incendiary.
Even though it’s been 7 years since they first met on that smoky Bristol dance floor, it finally feels like the world is ready for what Jus Now do. And with this latest EP behind them and a full live band featuring trumpeters, dancers, drummers and more in the works, it’s clear - Jus Now are ready for the world.

SERENITY HEARTBEAT
Serenity Heartbeat soll eine Platform sein um neue, oder bereits bekanntere Künstler kennen zulernen. Die angestrebte Musikrichtung sollte Deep - / Tech House sein, allerdings möchten wir die Künstler nicht dort hineinpressen sondern Ihnen viel mehr den Platz geben sich und Ihren Style auszuleben.
Für Feedback sind wir immer dankbar - gern dürft Ihr uns auch neue Künstler vorschlagen. Serenity Heartbeat sollte bestenfalls eine große Familie werden die durch die gemeinsam Leidenschaft zur Musik vereint ist <3

He began playing guitar and writing songs in 1994 in his home in Safety Harbor, Florida. Later he and his band performed in venues in and around Georgia, New York, and California. Some of the highlights include The Tabernacle in Atlanta, The Knitting Factory in NYC, and B B King’s in Universal City.
By day the talented and dedicated artist works as a music publisher and music supervisor, having supervised several feature films. Jody publishes a catalog of 20,000 + songs and regularly licenses music to networks, studios, ad agencies, and trailer houses.
Jody's released a couple of EP's including ""Rivers (2013)"" recorded with Grammy winning Multi-Platinum producer Scott Mathews (Beach Boys, Zac Brown, and Johnny Cash) & ""Memory Box (2015)"" recorded with Kenny Lamb (Ashley Monroe, Justin Timberlake). His artistry is reminiscent of early Paul McCartney, Cat Stevens, Dave Matthews, and Nick Drake.
Jody's been honored with several awards for his songwriting, including winning first place at CNN International Talent Competition, which was televised on various CNN programs.
His music has been heard on ABC, AMC, Animal Planet, NBC, Showtime, MTV, and Nickelodeon, to name a few.
""As a writer with others, I try to bring a sense of calmness and steadfast to the room, along with some lyrical ideas/topics & interesting melodies. If I had to choose, I'd say melody is my strong suit in a co-write. Because of the nature of my job as a music publisher & supervisor, I'm able to adapt to different writing styles from Pop to Rock to Country to Trailer Music.
Currently Jody is based in Orange County, California and travels to Nashville, TN annually to co-write with other accomplished songwriters. Some of his co-writers include Michele Vice-Maslin (Nick Carter, Ke$ha), Jason Mathews (Billy Currington, Trace Adkins, Luke Bryan), Phil Barton (Lee Brice), Steve Pasch (Lenny Kravitz), Elisha Hoffman (Faith Hill, “Country Strong” soundtrack), Rebecca Lynn Howard (Martina McBride), Steve Suliikowski and Joey Clement (Selena Gomez), and many other writers.",115,9,27,2,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:6542949

His obsession with the 1980s has led to the founding of Rosso Corsa Records and a revival of synthesizer music. With Rosso Corsa he is championing many artists such as Mitch Murder, Lazerhawk, Jordan F and Lost years to make 1980s-inspired music with modern fidelity.
Being among the pioneers of this revival, Mike’s first project Actrazer initially defined the Rosso Corsa sound together with output from label co-founder Lazerhawk. They coined their music Outrun, a genre of soundtrack music with epic leads and arpeggiated synths. At the same time, Kavinsky, the Outrunners and the Valerie Collective were all contributing to this new sound.
Since 2010 Michael Glover has been ecstatic about the success of his second project known as Miami Nights 1984 (MN84). Characterized by smooth synthesizers and nostalgic solos, this new sound accentuates the carefree feel of the 1980s.
The Miami Nights sound garnered support on an international scale with the official remix of ‘Somebody I Used To Know.’ by Gotye. It infuses 1980s charm with Gotye’s powerful voices and moody lyrics. Rollings Stone says it’s an “eighties-inspired synth-pop remix, inspired by [mike's] love of old John Hughes films” while VH1 says “It’s a synth-led 80s redux, and it’s pretty rad”
When asked about influences, Mike says he obviously takes from the 80s: “The music, movies, shows, cars and girls are all running through my imagination when I write a piece of music. I’m not happy with a piece of music unless I can imagine it as the soundtrack to a film or show. Ever since I was a child I enjoyed synth-based music like Tangerine Dream, Jean Michael Jarre and Ray Lynch.” His name coincides with the original run of the Miami Vice TV show on September 28, 1984.
In creating his sound he uses “a variation of analogue synths and virtual instruments in Abelton Live. I’ve been using more virtual instruments for convenience and ability to leave a project without worrying about getting the same sound again.” Many of the parts are first recorded from live instrumentation and tweaked afterward in Ableton.
Building on the successes of Rosso Corsa Records and an official Gotye remix, Mike released the second Miami Nights 1984 full length album Tubulence. Spanning 12 tracks, Turbulence builds upon the synth-pop charms and synthesizer solos from Miami’s first album with more character: orchestra stabs, percussive rushes, slow motion bends and epic interludes distinguish the album. So does the album’s more intense moments which promote the Outrun electro sound we have championed for many years.",35354,72,25,5,64,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:995505

The rise of Charlie Darker has been anything but ordinary. Tapped by some of the biggest names in dance music before he was even old enough to have a drink, the Canadian­-born phenom has been producing some of the most forward­thinking and hardest-­hitting Electro of the last few years.
Strongly influenced by the first wave of the mid-­late 2000s, it was acts like Justice, The Bloody Beetroots, MSTRKRFT, SebastiAn and more who ignited a desire to bring pure raw energy to the dance floor.
With mentors like Wolfgang Gartner and MSTRKRFT, he quickly crafted a one­-of-­a-­kind approach driven by cutting-­edge sound design leading to releases on Dim Mak, Kindergarten Records, Mad Decent and more. In 2013, at just 21 years-­old, Charlie Darker was invited by Tommy Trash and “Uncle Wolf”, as he calls his esteemed advisor, on their national Hounds of Hell tour playing to massive crowds at some of the most iconic venues in North America including Webster Hall, the Hollywood Palladium and Washington DC’s Echostage.
Moving forward to 2015, Charlie Darker has racked up impressive support from some of the top names in dance music including Tiesto, Zedd, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, David Guetta, Chuckie, Porter Robinson, Zeds Dead and countless others. He’s remixed the likes of Diplo, Wolfgang Gartner, Zedd, Felix Cartal & Autoérotique to great acclaim.
The past few months have seen him invited by Zedd to remix the mega hit“Beautiful Now” and release an explosive anthem called “D2B” on Dim Mak. With an ambitious EP ready to unleash on Big Beat later this year, there’s no telling what the future holds for this rising star.",25908,337,45,61,80,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:787032

SERENITY HEARTBEAT
Serenity Heartbeat soll eine Platform sein um neue, oder bereits bekanntere Künstler kennen zulernen. Die angestrebte Musikrichtung sollte Deep - / Tech House sein, allerdings möchten wir die Künstler nicht dort hineinpressen sondern Ihnen viel mehr den Platz geben sich und Ihren Style auszuleben.
Für Feedback sind wir immer dankbar - gern dürft Ihr uns auch neue Künstler vorschlagen. Serenity Heartbeat sollte bestenfalls eine große Familie werden die durch die gemeinsam Leidenschaft zur Musik vereint ist <3

Mostly known for his work as a producer for artists including Pete Yorn, Scarlett Johansson, Ariel Pink's Haunted Grafitti, Happy Mondays, Mickey Avalon, Alekesam, Mozella, Shaun Ryder, Asa Soltan, Lenka, Orelia, Keepaway and Hugh Masekela.
He made his mark on the Los Angeles music scene as a founding member of the cult-like satirical hip hop group THE TRILAMBS and as lead singer of the band MAATA HAARI. In 2009 LA tastemaker and DJ Bruno Guez, through his QUANGO label, released Sunny's solo album entitled LOVE RHINO to much critical acclaim, with particular attention paid to his haunting and poetic lyrics telling the story of love gone strange.
Along with his solo work, he's currently recording as BIGGEST CRUSH (with Zach Cowie) and BANGKOK STARTERS (with Joachim Cooder) and goes under the monikers ""SOONHEY"" and ""MISTER BUNNY"".
Sunny grew up surrounded by music. His father is renowned record producer STEWART LEVINE (Simply Red, Minnie Riperton, Dr. John, B.B. King, the Crusaders, Jamie Cullum, etc.), his uncle is rap producer QD3 (Ice Cube, 2 Pac, L.L. Cool J) and his grandfather is QUINCY JONES. It would be safe to say that the boy grew up in some studios….
Sunny spent his formative years between Los Angeles, upstate New York and London. Being a hip hop kid, his early years in music were as a DJ and then as a beat maker. In the mid 90s, during the advent of trip hop, Sunny's musicality clicked into gear and artists like Howie b., Massive Attack, and Portishead made it apparent that there was something more to do with the tools and methods set into play by hip
hop producers than strictly rap.
He recently composed the score and supplied original songs for the motion picture CELESTE AND JESSE FOREVER starring Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg, Elijah Wood, and Emma Roberts.

He began playing guitar and writing songs in 1994 in his home in Safety Harbor, Florida. Later he and his band performed in venues in and around Georgia, New York, and California. Some of the highlights include The Tabernacle in Atlanta, The Knitting Factory in NYC, and B B King’s in Universal City.
By day the talented and dedicated artist works as a music publisher and music supervisor, having supervised several feature films. Jody publishes a catalog of 20,000 + songs and regularly licenses music to networks, studios, ad agencies, and trailer houses.
Jody's released a couple of EP's including ""Rivers (2013)"" recorded with Grammy winning Multi-Platinum producer Scott Mathews (Beach Boys, Zac Brown, and Johnny Cash) & ""Memory Box (2015)"" recorded with Kenny Lamb (Ashley Monroe, Justin Timberlake). His artistry is reminiscent of early Paul McCartney, Cat Stevens, Dave Matthews, and Nick Drake.
Jody's been honored with several awards for his songwriting, including winning first place at CNN International Talent Competition, which was televised on various CNN programs.
His music has been heard on ABC, AMC, Animal Planet, NBC, Showtime, MTV, and Nickelodeon, to name a few.
""As a writer with others, I try to bring a sense of calmness and steadfast to the room, along with some lyrical ideas/topics & interesting melodies. If I had to choose, I'd say melody is my strong suit in a co-write. Because of the nature of my job as a music publisher & supervisor, I'm able to adapt to different writing styles from Pop to Rock to Country to Trailer Music.
Currently Jody is based in Orange County, California and travels to Nashville, TN annually to co-write with other accomplished songwriters. Some of his co-writers include Michele Vice-Maslin (Nick Carter, Ke$ha), Jason Mathews (Billy Currington, Trace Adkins, Luke Bryan), Phil Barton (Lee Brice), Steve Pasch (Lenny Kravitz), Elisha Hoffman (Faith Hill, “Country Strong” soundtrack), Rebecca Lynn Howard (Martina McBride), Steve Suliikowski and Joey Clement (Selena Gomez), and many other writers.",115,9,27,2,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:6542949

Despite a background playing in numerous metal bands in the late 90’s, he began pursuing a solo electronic project in 2002 incorporating a multitude of styles, often with a heavy influence of psychedelia.
Landed two remixes on renowned Brooklyn hardcore band Candiria’s “Toying With The Insanities, Vol. 3” 12” in 2010. Released two critically acclaimed records through AMDISCS: Futures Reserve Label, the first being “Nu.wav Hallucinations” in April 2013, which made numerous Best-Of-2013 lists (including Tiny Mix Tapes & Flavorwire) and was also played on the Rodarte, Sportmax, Céline, Ferragamo, and Lacoste runways for Fashion Week in Milan, New York, and Paris.
Released “Dream Sequins®” (★★★★1/2 on Tiny Mix Tapes) in 2014, which at one point was the 2nd highest-rated vaporwave album on RYM, under Chuck Person's ""Eccojams"", and is noted as ""taking the genre into uncharted and stratospheric territory"" (Ash Beks, The Essential). The title track garnered some attention after appearing in Bronze 56K Hardware’s ***TRUST*** DVD, as well as a long stint being played in Chipotle restaurants nationwide. Additionally, “Dream Sequins®” provided the soundtrack to Alex Czetwertynski’s original light installation “Blurware” at the 2016 Day For Night festival in Houston. The album has been regarded as a “cult classic” (Adrian Mark Lore, The Observer) and even made a fan out of Disney actor and titular voice of “Steven Universe”, Zach Callison.
Contributed a remix of ""Radio Breakdown"" for psychedelic giants The Amorphous Androgynous (aka The Future Sound Of London) on their Record Store Day exclusive 2x12” “The Cartel”, alongside DJ Food, Youth (of Killing Joke), and Noel Gallagher on bass and guitar. Organized the massive 22nd transmission of the Terminal Radio program on FutureMusic FM, recruiting the likes of FSOL, DJ Food, Youth, Mixmaster Morris, and Ishq to contribute exclusive mixes and material.
Released a 4+ hour psychedelic DJ mix of retro video game music ""Welcome To Warp Zone!"" in 2014, which was met with much acclaim in both the music and gaming communities, and garnered high praise from The Needle Drop and FACT Magazine. As of December 2019, “Welcome To Warp Zone!” is ranked #3 in RYM’s ‘Top DJ Mixes Of All-Time’.
Remixed Cal Chuchesta’s “Cocoa” single for the bonus track on “The New CALassic” mixtape, which reached #1 on Audiomack in August of 2015, and shared collaborative space with Joji (Filthy Frank) and the late 3Pac. Released a much-anticipated split LP “The Path To Lost Eden” (4.5/5 on RA) with t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者 on Dream Catalogue in 2015, spawning a fan-remix of the opening track by Zomby (XL Recordings).
2017 saw the release of “Pharma”, Nmesh’s Orange Milk Records debut. The double-album received remixes from a slew of notable artists, including Odd Nosdam, Traxman, and Humanoid (Brian Dougans of FSOL), as well as Orange Milk staples such as 食品まつり a.k.a foodman. The release was a critical success, receiving a 8/10 from Exclaim!, a 4/5 from Resident Advisor, ★★★★1/2 from TMT, and a “decent 7” from The Needle Drop. Gorilla vs. Bear ranked the album #58 on their ‘Albums Of 2017’ list. PopMatters put it at number 10 in their list of ‘Best Avant-Garde and Experimental Music of 2017’.
Curated the monolithic 100+ track charity compilation “Memories Overlooked: A Tribute To The Caretaker”, a collaborative effort of over 90 artists, paying tribute to Leyland Kirby’s long-running ambient project exploring memory loss, nostalgia and dementia via distorted pre-war ballroom music.
Nmesh has been featured in mixes from the likes of Gorilla vs. Bear, Dummy Mag, FACT, and Tiny Mix Tapes. Airplay on Rinse FM, BBC Radio 6, NTS Radio, and KEXP in Seattle.",7075,1558,153,1283,852,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:911667

The SIGIT was formed in the late ‘90s by four high school friends, who shared a mutual admiration for rock gods of the ‘70s. Discreetly in the classroom, the group would listen to their ‘70s influences, in addition to recent phenomenon like Brit-pop, shoegaze, and modern punk-rock. After class they would re-convene in the garage, where they emulated the variety of sounds and styles they heard that day. The SIGIT’s wide range of stylistic interests made it difficult initially to identify the music scene that would fit their inventive material.
Formed in the late ‘90s, a time when artists like Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears were dominating airwaves, The SIGIT wondered how their rock-based tendencies and reverence for multiple styles would be received by audiences. To find out, they began to send out invitations to a weekly garage gig, which featured beer, barbeque, and The SIGIT’s engaging music. The audience’s reaction was extremely positive, and the four-piece realized they would not be forced to confine to radio conventions to gain listeners. Their authentic love for good old rock ‘n’ roll would be more than enough.
In response to the popular garage gigs, The SIGIT released their debut EP in late 2004. Esteemed publications and labels like FFWD Records came calling, providing The SIGIT opportunities to perform outside their garage. With high-energy and passionate performances, their profile began to rise rapidly through live shows, setting the stage for The SIGIT's 2007 full-length debut, Visible Idea of Perfection. The album received glowing reviews, especially from Australian publications like Faster Louder. This led to The SIGIT's first international gigs, when they toured Australia for Visible Idea of Perfection. By 2009, The SIGIT were performing at US festivals like SXSW. That June, they released a collection of ten diverse songs entitled Hertz Dyslexia, which included a DVD of live footage and music videos. To celebrate the release, The SIGIT held a solo concert in Bandung, which was attended by a sold-out audience of over 3500 fans. A national tour would follow, and The SIGIT’s international presence would increase significantly.
The SIGIT recently released their second full-length album, Detourn. The title is a pun on the word “detournement”, a variation on a previous media work where the newly created one has a meaning that is antagonist to the original. The band started writing Detourn in 2009, and finally took to the studio in late 2011. Recording and mixing ended in January, and Detourn was released on March 16th via FFWD Records. Detourn has already received significant acclaim. Rolling Stone Indonesia gave the album 4 out 5 stars, praising Detourn for its mixture of anthemic rockers and intricately precise orchestration. Seven years between full-lengths, it was clear that The SIGIT knew how to relieve the anticipation.",22656,2,11,9,1,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:22857023

UK based DJ and producer Lucas O'Brien has been rounding up dancefloors and rocking them in the right direction since he started playing techno in the early nineties at renowned London clubs such as The End, Heaven, Club UK and Fabric.
His trance-infused techno music was found to crossover with the sounds being played in Goa in the early 90s and it was this that led him to an opportunity to play at some of the early, now legendary, TIP parties.
Lucas' vast experience has found him performing at many world famous institutions such as the V & A museum, the panoramic top floor of the Tate Museum of Modern Art and to a star-studded dancefloor opposite the diplodocus at the Natural History museum for the Harry Potter 3 premiere after-party.
Today, with two highly acclaimed albums to his name (God Save The Machine, Tales Of Heads) and many more collaborative projects in the pipeline (with artists such as Eat Static, Hallucinogen, Ajja, Martian Arts, Earthling, Outsiders, Avalon, Tristan, Dickster, Sonic Species and Laughing Buddha to name but a few) Lucas is best known as a leading psytrance DJ representing Raja Ram's label TIP Records globally with his unique driving UK psychedelic sound.
Lucas shows no signs of slowing with his touring this year stretching as far afield as Europe, Russia, US, South America, Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australia. The same can be said for his studio productions with his solo psytrance album on the way, new tracks forthcoming from Sybarite and some techno projects in the pipeline too (including a track on the new Nanoplex album on Iboga Records).
Known for his masterful mixing and excellent musical taste, he has become a firm favourite in well respected clubs and festivals worldwide.",19730,429,83,10,29,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:262773

Both a brand and an author, whose is the mind drawing the plans under that name? Whoever he is, he wanted to let the creativity that lies deep within run free, and has carved out his first tracks by cementing a solid base of sonic material made up of pure techno with minimalist touches. Pure concrete straight from Chicago with Detroit ripples and forged of alloys derived from the most genuine Soul.
Drinking from the fountain of intelligent techno, this recently graduated architect starts his career demonstrating that, having absorbed the teachings of the classics, his time has come. Architectural has come to stay. This is not just another name, Architectural has earned it and become someone who will explore new avenues in the deepest and most mental electronic music you’ve ever danced before.
This powerful edifice which rises sky-high, laid its foundations and basic structure in Architectural 001 and 002, which presents us the blows, clicks, snaps and twisting resulting from the construction crew’s hard labour and exploitation of a dark desolate ground under the instructions of an Architect, whose mind generates the project that builds up before us.
After the elation with which his first projects where welcomed by the most well known European dj’s, Architectural continues his building project with a surprising 3rd EP. Architectural 003 proves that this is no rookie, he’s a blazing star showing such a high level of creativity and innovation that leaves no room for doubt. We give ourselves over to a captivating rhythm, and it's a privilege. We are participating in the birth of a new sound structure which will lay the foundations of a style many will follow.
At the endings of 2011 Architectural presents his 4th work: Architectural 004. This is the culmination of the first structure planned by this artist, but is sure that it will not be the last.
A 5th part of his project is now in the design phase: ¿which surprises will it give us? We will discover it soon: don't miss the musical construction project of Architectural.

Al mismo tiempo sello y autor ¿quien hay tras este nuevo nombre y los proyectos que está creando? Sea quien sea, ha querido dar rienda suelta a la creatividad que latía bajo su piel y ha esculpido los primeros tracks que cimentarán una sólida base de materia sónica compuesta por puro techno con toques minimalistas, hormigón proveniente de Chicago, con vetas detroitianas y forjado de aleaciones derivadas del soul más genuino.
Bebiendo de la escuela del ‘Intelligent Techno’ este recién licenciado arquitecto comienza su carrera demostrando que, una vez ha interiorizado las enseñanzas de los clásicos, ha llegado su hora: Architectural ha venido para quedarse, no es un nombre más: es por méritos propios alguien que va a marcar un nuevo camino en la electrónica de baile más profunda y mental que hayas bailado.
Esta poderosa edificación que empieza a alzarse pone sus cimientos y estructura básica en Architectural 001 y 002, que nos presentan los impactos, chasquidos y torsiones que provoca todo el equipo de construcción enfrascado en su tarea, explotando un oscuro terreno desolado, siguiendo las indicaciones del Arquitecto que genera en su mente todo el proyecto que irá alzándose ante nosotros.
Tras una exultante acogida de sus primeros proyectos por parte de los más reconocidos dj’s europeos, Architectural continúa su proyecto constructivo con un sorprendente tercer EP: Architectural 003 es la constatación de que no nos encontramos ante un ‘rookie’, una estrella fulgurante: exhibe tal nivel de creatividad e innovación que no deja lugar a dudas: entregarnos a su cautivador ritmo es un privilegio, es participar en el nacimiento de una nueva estructura sonora que va a marcar un estilo que muchos tratarán de seguir.
No ha muerto todavía el año 2011 cuando el afán productivo de Architectural nos entrega su cuarto trabajo: Architectural 004. Culmina así la primera estructura proyectada por este artista, la que a buen seguro, no va a ser el único elemento creado por él.

A melodic masterpiece, signed off by duo Euphoric Nation. Formed in 2010, Euphoric Nation originally composed of one member, current creative Don Ortega. Evolving into a duo, Euphoric Nation became a two person project earlier this year with the addition of Justin Zanish.
Trance is the name of the game for Don, as you’ll only find him either producing or DJing Trance. He’s notorious within the Minneapolis music scene for being both a true Trance fan and strong judge of trending music quality. Don’s split presence as a promoter and producer provides a knowledge of what music will succeed in the electronic market. His insight helps Euphoric Nation decide which projects to invest their time and energy into, guiding the team in their professional network and production layout.
On the flipside, Euphoric Nation’s second member, Justin Zanish, has helped elevate an already flying project. While Justin’s roots lay in Progressive House, his move into Progressive Trance took on a life of its own. Justin’s previous project, “Zan & Ezi”, was the byproduct of an adoration for Trance. Justin’s notoriety for soul-consuming, passionate music has helped fine-tune his creative capabilities. He can make “that last edit”, or extra step musically that really help float a masterpiece above a sea of art. Especially in today’s daily-release age, it is fundamental for up-and-coming music to stand out from the rest.
Euphoric Nation is set to expand the way for Minneapolis Trance. Our talent is becoming a beast of its own. We hope to see you at a future booking!",1364,372,527,84,300,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:1872555

TIP Party at HillTop, Hill Top, GOA, India
Powered by GigaTools
UK based DJ and producer Lucas O'Brien has been rounding up dancefloors and rocking them in the right direction since he started playing techno in the early nineties at renowned London clubs such as The End, Heaven, Club UK and Fabric.
His trance-infused techno music was found to crossover with the sounds being played in Goa in the early 90s and it was this that led him to an opportunity to play at some of the early, now legendary, TIP parties.
Lucas' vast experience has found him performing at many world famous institutions such as the V & A museum, the panoramic top floor of the Tate Museum of Modern Art and to a star-studded dancefloor opposite the diplodocus at the Natural History museum for the Harry Potter 3 premiere after-party.
Today, with two highly acclaimed albums to his name (God Save The Machine, Tales Of Heads) and many more collaborative projects in the pipeline (with artists such as Eat Static, Hallucinogen, Ajja, Martian Arts, Earthling, Outsiders, Avalon, Tristan, Dickster, Sonic Species and Laughing Buddha to name but a few) Lucas is best known as a leading psytrance DJ representing Raja Ram's label TIP Records globally with his unique driving UK psychedelic sound.
Lucas shows no signs of slowing with his touring this year stretching as far afield as Europe, Russia, US, South America, Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australia. The same can be said for his studio productions with his solo psytrance album on the way, new tracks forthcoming from Sybarite and some techno projects in the pipeline too (including a track on the new Nanoplex album on Iboga Records).
Known for his masterful mixing and excellent musical taste, he has become a firm favourite in well respected clubs and festivals worldwide.",19730,429,83,10,29,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:262773

Both a brand and an author, whose is the mind drawing the plans under that name? Whoever he is, he wanted to let the creativity that lies deep within run free, and has carved out his first tracks by cementing a solid base of sonic material made up of pure techno with minimalist touches. Pure concrete straight from Chicago with Detroit ripples and forged of alloys derived from the most genuine Soul.
Drinking from the fountain of intelligent techno, this recently graduated architect starts his career demonstrating that, having absorbed the teachings of the classics, his time has come. Architectural has come to stay. This is not just another name, Architectural has earned it and become someone who will explore new avenues in the deepest and most mental electronic music you’ve ever danced before.
This powerful edifice which rises sky-high, laid its foundations and basic structure in Architectural 001 and 002, which presents us the blows, clicks, snaps and twisting resulting from the construction crew’s hard labour and exploitation of a dark desolate ground under the instructions of an Architect, whose mind generates the project that builds up before us.
After the elation with which his first projects where welcomed by the most well known European dj’s, Architectural continues his building project with a surprising 3rd EP. Architectural 003 proves that this is no rookie, he’s a blazing star showing such a high level of creativity and innovation that leaves no room for doubt. We give ourselves over to a captivating rhythm, and it's a privilege. We are participating in the birth of a new sound structure which will lay the foundations of a style many will follow.
At the endings of 2011 Architectural presents his 4th work: Architectural 004. This is the culmination of the first structure planned by this artist, but is sure that it will not be the last.
A 5th part of his project is now in the design phase: ¿which surprises will it give us? We will discover it soon: don't miss the musical construction project of Architectural.

Al mismo tiempo sello y autor ¿quien hay tras este nuevo nombre y los proyectos que está creando? Sea quien sea, ha querido dar rienda suelta a la creatividad que latía bajo su piel y ha esculpido los primeros tracks que cimentarán una sólida base de materia sónica compuesta por puro techno con toques minimalistas, hormigón proveniente de Chicago, con vetas detroitianas y forjado de aleaciones derivadas del soul más genuino.
Bebiendo de la escuela del ‘Intelligent Techno’ este recién licenciado arquitecto comienza su carrera demostrando que, una vez ha interiorizado las enseñanzas de los clásicos, ha llegado su hora: Architectural ha venido para quedarse, no es un nombre más: es por méritos propios alguien que va a marcar un nuevo camino en la electrónica de baile más profunda y mental que hayas bailado.
Esta poderosa edificación que empieza a alzarse pone sus cimientos y estructura básica en Architectural 001 y 002, que nos presentan los impactos, chasquidos y torsiones que provoca todo el equipo de construcción enfrascado en su tarea, explotando un oscuro terreno desolado, siguiendo las indicaciones del Arquitecto que genera en su mente todo el proyecto que irá alzándose ante nosotros.
Tras una exultante acogida de sus primeros proyectos por parte de los más reconocidos dj’s europeos, Architectural continúa su proyecto constructivo con un sorprendente tercer EP: Architectural 003 es la constatación de que no nos encontramos ante un ‘rookie’, una estrella fulgurante: exhibe tal nivel de creatividad e innovación que no deja lugar a dudas: entregarnos a su cautivador ritmo es un privilegio, es participar en el nacimiento de una nueva estructura sonora que va a marcar un estilo que muchos tratarán de seguir.
No ha muerto todavía el año 2011 cuando el afán productivo de Architectural nos entrega su cuarto trabajo: Architectural 004. Culmina así la primera estructura proyectada por este artista, la que a buen seguro, no va a ser el único elemento creado por él.
Una 5ª fase de su proyecto está ya en fase de diseño: ¿qué sorpresas nos depara? Pronto lo sabremos: no te pierdas el proyecto de construcción musical que traza Architectural.",11407,8,57,1,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:1254765

The teacher is Evan Bruce Wilson who serves as pastor of All Souls Christian Church in Moscow, Idaho and is director of the philosophy and hospitality ministry called The Big Haus Society. The material consists largely of considering and answering the questions of how to live before God by understanding the world and the Scriptures. The motto of The Big Haus is ""It's the thought that counts."" It is also a firm belief in this teaching that while the universe is subject to Futility, the Peace of God is available to those who seek. Such tranquility (regardless of calamity around us) is in finding the Order of thought and life which God has revealed. The Biblical teaching is exegetical and rational with a commitment to what C.S. Lewis described as ""mere Christianity"". The Bible studies generally cover a book of the Bible in a 4 to 6 week session while the seminars address philosophies of human relationships in five lectures. These include understanding the Self, as man or woman, establishing a marriage wisely and child rearing with good effect. Occasionally there will be seminars addressing academic topics (such as history), or other philosophical topics (such as Manners or Crucial Concepts) that aid in living wisely and beautifully.",145,0,509,1,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:60584294

But the ""whys"" of Judaism were always left out. ""Why should I believe Judaism to be true?"" and ""Why should Judaism make a difference in my life?"" were questions that were constantly overlooked, never receiving full or satisfactory answers.
This always bothered me.
So when I had the opportunity, I wanted to look into the foundational beliefs of Judaism for myself. I wanted to see if there was a case to be made for the authenticity of Judaism.
My search took me to Israel to investigate and elucidate the philosophical tenets of Jewish belief. “Why should I believe in God?” “Why should I believe God gave the Torah?”
In Jerusalem, I was surprised to come across thought-out and reasonable approaches to the roots and truths of Judaism... and this led me to develop a stronger passion and commitment towards it in my life.
As the ""whys"" were met with solid responses, my pursuit evolved from philosophical questions to spiritual inquiries. I wanted to understand the deeper reasons behind why we do what we do. This led me to the teachings of deeper Jewish wisdom, such as Chassidus and Kabbalah, which opened the door to a fuller picture and more meaningful practice of Torah and Jewish life.
Since then, I've been privileged to share and disseminate the ""whys"" of Judaism – both philosophical and spiritual – to a wide and varied international audience by bringing down, clarifying and packaging these teachings in a way that is accessible, relevant and motivational for Jews of all levels of Jewish background, observance, and education.
I have been blessed to author numerous books that have helped to answer questions, debunk misconceptions and open thousands of hearts and minds of wandering and wondering Jews. ""Jewish By Choice"" and ""The Case For Judaism"" went on to become #1 Best Sellers, and numerous other works have become popular and continue to make a difference.
Currently, I live with my family in the Old City of Jerusalem, where my wife and I spend the majority of our time teaching, mentoring, writing, counselling, learning, hosting, and always looking for new, creative and innovative ways to spread the light of Torah and Judaism far and wide.

DJ Rashad has been instrumental to the creation and evolution of Chicago Juke music and has been lifelong friends with other key players on the scene such as Paul Johnson, DJ Gant-Man, DJ Spinn, DJ Godfather and Jammin Gerald. He has the ability to blend elements of house, ghetto house, disco, juke, and ghetto tech together with a knack for creating sparse, snappy tracks that manage to convey a physicality and funk with spectacular precision.
Along with his teammates DJ Spinn and DJ Gant-Man, DJ Rashad has become notorious for making Juke anthems that have made fans outside the world of Chicago mix cds. He’s released records on Dancemania, Juke Trax, Planet Mu, created his own label, Ghettophiles, as well as had featured remixes on BBE, Palms Out Sounds, and Movel Traxx. He’s received press coverage from DJ Mag, XLR8R, Fact, Resident Advisor, as well as Rip It Up. Additionally, he’s headlined parties such as London’s Night Slugs, Brussel’s Regulate, Chicago’s Mad Decent Block Party, and New York City’s Turrbotax and Moma’s PS1 events.",21199,0,7,,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:2493734

Their passion began with making people move on dance floors across New York. As time went by, they became known for their eclectic and wide-ranging music taste, playing everything from Dance and Hip-Hop, to world music and everything in between. DJ sets alongside Fabulous, Mel DeBarge, Knife Party, and many more in New York City, Washington D.C., Miami, Boston, Israel, and other major cities around the world helped solidify the duo as a major NY-based music force. Eventually, Mateen and Matt branched into music production, both having taken on multiple music projects of their own.

In the 4 years preceding this event he had been experimenting at an Arts Council funded studio in Newcastle whilst at University. His early work resulted in 3 cassette only releases on the Mirage label as well as several local concerts. These early tapes showed Boddy gradually forming his own style through a long self teaching process in the techniques of analogue synthesis and tape manipulation.
After the success of 1983 he went on to release another 2 vinyl albums, Spirits and Phoenix, as well as performing several concerts throughout the UK. However it wasn't until 1989 that his first CD release, Odyssey, came out on the EM label Surreal to Real. After Drive, his second release on the Surreal label Boddy formed his own record label, Something Else Records , through which he released a further 4 solo albums as well as reissuing his 3 early vinyl albums and the cassette only release Jade on CD. Furthermore he released three collaborative CD releases with some of Europes finest exponents of EM, namely Andy Pickford, Ron Boots and Mark Shreeve.
He continued to expand his concert appearences which have now surpassed over 100 events with concerts in the UK ( including several more UK Electronica appearances, two shows at the Jodrell Bank Planetarium & two at the National Space Centre), Holland ( five festival appearances ), Germany and three shows in Philadelphia, USA.
Alongside these mainstream EM activities Boddy has also built for himself a formidable reputuation as a sound designer having produced a series of sample CD's & virtual instruments for sampling specialists Time & Space. In late 2008 Boddy set up his own downloadable sample CD company with the Waveforms series of sample packs. Furthermore he is also involved in library music having composed 11 such CD's for the publishing company deWolfe as well as producing some music for a computer games company.
Thus we come up to the present with the formation of his DiN label in 1999. Unlike his private Something Else Records the DiN label was set up to allow Boddy to actively form different collaborations with a wide variety of musicians as well as release other artists music. DiN has achieved widespread critical acclaim for it's adventurous outlook at the world of EM and has seen 39 releases with Boddy being involved in 21 of these ( five solo and sixteen collaborative projects ).
In 2008 DiN expanded it's catalogue with a series of download only releases featuring Boddy in concert both as a solo performer and with other DiN artists.",2285,25,54,16,15,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:1057468

Bonn E Maiy (formerly Bonnie Rabson) is a vocalist and performer currently residing in south Florida. Just like the path of her ancestor Myles Standish, who sailed the Mayflower and led the Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony, Bonn.E.Maiy’s music journeyed from Europe to the U.S., and is set to explore a new world and redefine boundaries.
With a unique vocal tone somewhere between Florence Welch and Christina Perri, Bonn.E.Maiy’s debut album, Maiyflower, combines genres and perspectives - to show the unfiltered realities of her life. Having personally lived through topics ranging from childhood bullying, to facing and eventually overcoming substance abuse - Bonn.E.Maiy brings you closer to the highs and lows that define her, with a message of love, strength, and rebirth.
As a youth growing up in Erin, Ontario, this free spirit started in opera and theater - and in later years experimented and found traction in the European dance scene, which led to a 6-week completely independent tour of Hungary and surrounding areas in Summer 2017. She had always been attracted to the rawness, transitions, and freedom of arrangements of alternative / indie rock, and in 2014 started working with different sounds at Sound Business Recordings’ facility, which eventually culminated into the Maiyflower EP.
Rarely today do we find an artist with pure talent, pure intent, and an incessant work ethic to make music for the sake of creating beautiful art.

There were a string of tasty edits and the remixes for Keane, Moby and The Golden Filter. Endorsments from the likes of Erol Alkan and Aeroplane. A few festival slots and high profile club bookings. But still, when, sometime in back end of 2010, Villa started to tiptoe into their modest corner of the limelight, it was still a project into its growing pains. Originally rooted from the DJ partnership of Ghent duo Thang & Fredo, it wasn't until the former spend some time in the home studio of his long-time buddy Francois Demeyer that the definite shape of Villa is drawn up.
Many moons ago, these boys rubbed shoulders in the short-lived local band Foxylane, but while Thang's well developing DJ ambitions took him elsewhere, Francois followed his own path - which lead to being part of the line up of Belgian's fashion darlings Vive La Fête, hooking up with The Glimmers for Disko Drunkards and crafting soulful poptunes with his own band Soapstarter.
Now, the decades long club experience from Thang, matched with multi-instrumentalist Francois' well honed studio skills are a match made in disco heaven! Right?
“Right!”, says Francois. “Disco is at the core of Villa, but we don't want to be confined by endless arpeggios and other cosmic trickery. There's so much more sounds out there, endless shades of disco to toy with.” His cohort agrees: “Everything we put out there must have a heart, an organic groove, a soul; anything to make it hit you where it matters. That comes first and foremost - we'll leave the labeling to the bloggers”. “Although we'd love to coin the phrase 'hyper-disco'!”, Francois jumps in laughingly.
All jokery aside, the online community will be happy to know that the pair are currently working on there 2nd EP, but first they unleash a bundle of impressive remixes, beginning with their hyper charged rework of The Human League's 'Night People'. Also be sure to watch out for Villa's anthemic take on Adele's 'Rolling In The Deep', a rework of Yeasayer's 'I Remember' that sounds like it's born out of a cloud of grilled mushrooms (the good kind), and their Deep Space Nine-ish remodeling of Digitalism's 'Blitz'.
It took a few years for these two buds to discover their creative compatibility, but as Villa they're off with a flying start. Keep your eye on the sky.

Hailing from Southern France, Amine Edge & DANCE have taken the dance world by storm with their ground-breaking sound and high energy shows. Mining the musical spectrum and taking inspiration from early House, Philli Funk, 80's Hip-House and everything in between, Amine Edge & DANCE bring their own cross-genre blend of Tech and House to clubs and festivals across the globe. Having enjoyed a meteoric rise, the CUFF label bosses have now cemented themselves as the leaders of their genre and the go-to guys for the best dressed parties in town!
Not content with just being superstar DJs, the duo are also skilled producers and can regularly be found riding high in the the top charts. Their undeniable ear for a catchy hook and a knack of crafting moody, future-facing club edits is evident in their versions of Frank Ocean's 'Lost' and the Notorious B.I.G-sampling 'Going To Heaven With The Goodie-Goodies' - two tracks that show the breadth of their musical influences and their biggest 'hands-in-the-air' hits to date.
With a slew of new releases being lined up and their label, CUFF - a collective of artists much more talented than most - going from strength to strength and making its mark as a musical movement all of its own, 2016 promises to be the biggest year yet for the best mates from Marseille and the year when their own brand of Hip-Hop influenced bass heavy House will dominate the sound of the best parties in the biggest cities across the globe. www.AmineEdgeAndDANCE.com",38838,233,12,48,21,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:3248709

LATINO RESISTE
One of the most interesting up and coming producers now is the Czech native operating in Peru under Chong-X.
Chong-X has started with his own music production in the early days of 1996 in ragga - jungle style. (chongx: @chongx ) That led him in 2000 to now nonexistent Aphrikka sound system, where he became regular performer, most often in tandem with DJ Mad4ce. His production on the Czech scene gained fame mainly through his novel remixes, many riddims and by the original dubstep or variations of classical Jamaican standards.
In 2005, the Aphrikka sound system transformed into Roots 'n' Future collective, with which Chong-X continued his successful live performances. A few years ago, his interested began moving towards the Tropical, Global Bass and just recently to Moombahton, integrating both into its production, and into his DJ set.
In 2010, along with his equally talented fellow producer @don-pedropoulos based digital label, Lamat Records, which focuses on the fusion of local traditional genre with the current sound of European dance floors - Global Bass, Tropical, Moombahton. The first feat of the label appeared in the April 2011 split E.P. titled ""Hulk Attack"" on two tracks from both producers.

We believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, His atoning death, glorious resurrection, and His imminent return. We believe that He has provided salvation, which is our solely by grace through faith. We believe that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit and kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last day.

LATINO RESISTE
One of the most interesting up and coming producers now is the Czech native operating in Peru under Chong-X.
Chong-X has started with his own music production in the early days of 1996 in ragga - jungle style. (chongx: @chongx ) That led him in 2000 to now nonexistent Aphrikka sound system, where he became regular performer, most often in tandem with DJ Mad4ce. His production on the Czech scene gained fame mainly through his novel remixes, many riddims and by the original dubstep or variations of classical Jamaican standards.
In 2005, the Aphrikka sound system transformed into Roots 'n' Future collective, with which Chong-X continued his successful live performances. A few years ago, his interested began moving towards the Tropical, Global Bass and just recently to Moombahton, integrating both into its production, and into his DJ set.
In 2010, along with his equally talented fellow producer @don-pedropoulos based digital label, Lamat Records, which focuses on the fusion of local traditional genre with the current sound of European dance floors - Global Bass, Tropical, Moombahton. The first feat of the label appeared in the April 2011 split E.P. titled ""Hulk Attack"" on two tracks from both producers.

King Bone began his musical journey during his sophomore year of high school but it wasn’t until after graduation that he began to take his craft seriously. Inspired by the likes of Andre 3000, Meek Mill, Lil Wayne, Drake, and Justin Bieber, King Bone has set out to make his voice heard.
In 2008, King Bone got his first taste of success with the release of “Leanin.” The song and video quickly gained popularity throughout Aurora and became a staple in the club scene. A couple of years later, King Bone and a team of three other artists released “The Midwest Monsters” mixtape hosted by DJ Holiday. The mixtape has surpassed over half a million views and over 100,000 downloads, giving King Bone a wave of confidence and solidifying his place as a true artist. In 2012 KB dropped “Bonher,” his highly anticipated solo mixtape. Even though the project was his first ever solo effort, it was viewed over 300,000 times on the day it released and to date has been viewed over one million times. Coming off the success of his last mixtape, King Bone released his first ever single, “Sean Combs.” Not long after its release, the track caught the attention of comedian and actor Faizon Love, who added it to his comedy tour. To date, the official “Sean Combs” music video has been viewed over 600,000 times. King Bone is currently signed to Next Records and is working hard to bring his fans even more quality music.

New York City’s own Hip-Hop aficionado, DJ CLARK KENT, discovered Ski Beatz during a performance with the “BIZZIE BOYS” after opening up for the legendary MC DANA DANE. Ski Beatz was originally known as “MC WILL-SKI” and was a member of the group “ORIGINAL FLAVOR”, which was the first group, managed by future recording industry executive DAMON DASH. Ski Beatz began to produce music for rap duo, CAMP LO on their first debut album “UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT” which peaked at NUMBER 27 on the BILLBOARD 200 CHART and spawned the hit single, “LUCHINI AKA THIS IS IT” reaching the TOP 5 on the HOT RAP SINGLES CHART. Soon after, Damon Dash commissioned Ski Beatz to work on the debut album of another artist on his roster, JAY Z. Jay Z’s album “REASONABLE DOUBT” marked another major production placement in Ski Beatz career. Ski Beatz produced four tracks off the album, including the hit singles “DEAD PRESIDENTS” which was a commercial success as indicated by its RIAA CERTIFICATION as a GOLD SINGLE and “FEELIN’ IT” the fourth single. After the critical success of Reasonable Doubt, Ski Beatz formed ROC-A-BLOK PRODUCTIONS in affiliation with Jay Z and Dame Dash famous record label ROC-A-FELLA RECORDS, working with Camp Lo and SPORTY THIEVEZ. Ski Beatz crafted most of Camp Lo’s debut, which dropped in 1997 and provided Camp Lo with most of the production for their second album LET’S DO IT AGAIN, and their third album BLACK HOLLYWOOD. Ski Beatz continued to work with Jay-Z on his sophomore album “IN MY LIFETIME, VOL. 1” while simultaneously producing compilations and non-solo album projects with the likes of NATURE, members of the NEW JERSEY CREW, THE OUTSIDAZ, LIL’ KIM, BAHAMADIA, PITTSBURG SLIM, FOXY BROWN, RAS KASS, PROOF, FUNKDOOBIEST, AZ and FAT JOE single “JOHN BLAZE”. In 2009, Ski Beatz returned back to his music roots after a short hiatus by meeting up with DAMON DASH and joining the pioneering entrepreneur in his newest venture DD172 MEDIA COLLECTIVE, an umbrella organization that redefines Art, Music, Fashion, Filmmaking, and Publishing. Under the DD172 music division, BLUROC RECORDS, Ski Beatz fell right back into the fold with a new album and brand of music titled “24 HOUR KARATE SCHOOL”.

Ian grew up in a small town in Maryland, USA; about 2 hours from Washington DC. He was exposed to music at a young age, as his father (RIP) was a live sound engineer and ran a sound reinforcement company. His father engineered for such groups as Kool and The Gang and The Duke Ellington Orchestra. Also, his mother played guitar and sang as a hobby. By the time he was 7 years old he was able to mic a stage for a concert and travel along with his father during summer vacation making tour stops all over America from east to west. In high school, he played drums and was even in the school marching band.
Ian discovered dance music while he was in college. Already a part of the graffiti-writing scene in Baltimore, MD he met hip-hop DJs which led him to his next passion. So, he put down his spray can and bought some turntables. He started djing and played mostly hip-hop. Then worked at Music Liberated in Baltimore as a buyer/sales rep where he was properly introduced to house music.
His friends recommended his first setup. He bought a Pentium computer running at
100MHz, an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler, E-mu Orbit, Planet Phat and the Proteus 2000. With that, he made his very first vocal production (with Jason Papillon as Soul Providers) ""Rise"". It was a crossover hit and went Gold in the UK.
It wasn’t long before Ian decided to move to Europe, as it was more convenient to be closer to the place the dance music scene thrives. His signature “funky bass line” sound grew and eventually propelled the demand for his top-notch productions, especially remixes. In one single week, Ian held 8 mixes on the UK Upfront Club Top 40*.

Ian grew up in a small town in Maryland, USA; about 2 hours from Washington DC. He was exposed to music at a young age, as his father (RIP) was a live sound engineer and ran a sound reinforcement company. His father engineered for such groups as Kool and The Gang and The Duke Ellington Orchestra. Also, his mother played guitar and sang as a hobby. By the time he was 7 years old he was able to mic a stage for a concert and travel along with his father during summer vacation making tour stops all over America from east to west. In high school, he played drums and was even in the school marching band.
Ian discovered dance music while he was in college. Already a part of the graffiti-writing scene in Baltimore, MD he met hip-hop DJs which led him to his next passion. So, he put down his spray can and bought some turntables. He started djing and played mostly hip-hop. Then worked at Music Liberated in Baltimore as a buyer/sales rep where he was properly introduced to house music.
His friends recommended his first setup. He bought a Pentium computer running at
100MHz, an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler, E-mu Orbit, Planet Phat and the Proteus 2000. With that, he made his very first vocal production (with Jason Papillon as Soul Providers) ""Rise"". It was a crossover hit and went Gold in the UK.
It wasn’t long before Ian decided to move to Europe, as it was more convenient to be closer to the place the dance music scene thrives. His signature “funky bass line” sound grew and eventually propelled the demand for his top-notch productions, especially remixes. In one single week, Ian held 8 mixes on the UK Upfront Club Top 40*.
Clubbers, djs, and fans who demanded to know more created an influx of interviews from radio, magazines and people like MTV. The most exclusive to date - an impressive 8 page spread (and 2 hour DVD) exploring the intimate details of his production techniques in the very prominent Future Music Magazine - published in many languages and countries worldwide.

Brass Knuckles, the production powerhouse made up of Anthony Pisano, Danny D’Brito and Tony Livadas, fuses together elements of electro, traditional house and rock N roll to bring listeners a fresh new version of big room house music.
The group came together in 2009 when D'Brito and Livadas, who had been playing in bands together over the course of several years, connected with Pisano and began working as a production trio. The group’s first breakthrough single came in 2012 with “Bad Habits”, which peaked at #27 on the Billboard Club Play Charts and #45 on the Billboard Dance Charts. Brass Knuckles supported the single with non-stop touring, including numerous runs across North America as well as tours throughout Europe and Asia.
In May 2014, the group released their single ""Crack,"" a collaboration with The Cataracs, which received praise from This Song Is Sick, YourEDM, Dancing Astronaut, and DJ support from Showtek, Nervo, R3hab, Dada Life, Tritonal, and many more. Following this release, Brass Knuckles embarked on a ten date tour of Asia, their third tour throughout the territory, which ended with a main stage performance at Ultra Korea. Their latest release, a remix of Dada Life's ""One Smile,"" came out on August 12, 2014 with strong blog and DJ support.
Their newest single “Water Gun”, out August 26th in all stores, will be streaming exclusively on Beats Music for one week prior to release, starting August 19th. “Water Gun” blasts you in the face with a cool dose of upbeat piano melodies while the sing-along vocals by John Ryan are sure to get stuck in your head for days to come.
D’Brito often tells journalists, ""We don't look at ourselves like a DJ group, we look at this as a band” and once you’ve seen Brass Knuckles live, you will understand his reference. Livadas takes the stage each night, walking out to a packed venue while playing technical melodies on guitar while Pisano and D’Brito mix records and trigger live samples, making for an engaging, energy-packed show that is sure to get people moving.

In 2012, he decided to change his artist name and to Chris Dixis, he also changed his musical style and created a Soundcloud-page where he shared retro sets. Fans asked for more, so he decided to do this regularly. ...
Thanks to the sharing of his sets, clubs like ""Dance Hall"", ""Arenchi"", '' Real '',""Lazzura"", ""Montini"", ""La Rocca Backstage"", ""Le Barocco"", '' beachland Festival '' etc. started booking him and he became resident of the Club System Reunions.
Chris shared the turntables with great artists such as Phi-Phi, Ghost, Mackenzie, Dave Kane, Sven Lanvin, Philip, Franky Jones, Jan Vervloet, Youri, Bountyhunter and many others ...
He is well known for Retro House, Trance and Hard Trance but he's also into underground-styles like Deep House, Techhouse,Melodic House,and Progressive House.
Chris Dixis prefers vinyl but is not afraid of modern media.

Brass Knuckles, the production powerhouse made up of Anthony Pisano, Danny D’Brito and Tony Livadas, fuses together elements of electro, traditional house and rock N roll to bring listeners a fresh new version of big room house music.
The group came together in 2009 when D'Brito and Livadas, who had been playing in bands together over the course of several years, connected with Pisano and began working as a production trio. The group’s first breakthrough single came in 2012 with “Bad Habits”, which peaked at #27 on the Billboard Club Play Charts and #45 on the Billboard Dance Charts. Brass Knuckles supported the single with non-stop touring, including numerous runs across North America as well as tours throughout Europe and Asia.
In May 2014, the group released their single ""Crack,"" a collaboration with The Cataracs, which received praise from This Song Is Sick, YourEDM, Dancing Astronaut, and DJ support from Showtek, Nervo, R3hab, Dada Life, Tritonal, and many more. Following this release, Brass Knuckles embarked on a ten date tour of Asia, their third tour throughout the territory, which ended with a main stage performance at Ultra Korea. Their latest release, a remix of Dada Life's ""One Smile,"" came out on August 12, 2014 with strong blog and DJ support.
Their newest single “Water Gun”, out August 26th in all stores, will be streaming exclusively on Beats Music for one week prior to release, starting August 19th. “Water Gun” blasts you in the face with a cool dose of upbeat piano melodies while the sing-along vocals by John Ryan are sure to get stuck in your head for days to come.
D’Brito often tells journalists, ""We don't look at ourselves like a DJ group, we look at this as a band” and once you’ve seen Brass Knuckles live, you will understand his reference. Livadas takes the stage each night, walking out to a packed venue while playing technical melodies on guitar while Pisano and D’Brito mix records and trigger live samples, making for an engaging, energy-packed show that is sure to get people moving.

São 24 anos de estrada falando do amor de Deus através do seu rock n´roll inteligente e divertido. Além de tocarem por todo Brasil, já passaram pelos EUA, Europa, África e América Latina.
Desde o lançamento do seu primeiro trabalho, de forma independente e ainda em Vinil em 1991, já são 13 cds lançados, 9 em estúdio, 1 acústico , 3 ao vivo, além de 3 DVDs, os últimos lançados pela Sony Music.
Sem abrir mão do autêntico rock’n'roll, mesclou outras tendências em seus trabalhos, como baladas, canções românticas, louvor & adoração, além de estilos alternativos.
Sempre preocupados com a qualidade da sonoridade dos seus trabalhos, seus CDs foram produzidos por produtores renomados como Rick Bonadio, Paulo Anhaia e Dudu Borges, que de produtor virou integrante em 2011, e agora deixa a banda seguindo sua carreira de produtor de sucesso.
O humor é parte do cotidiano da banda, o grupo não dá sinais de envelhecimento, pelo contrário, com uma agenda de shows lotada, figura entre as principais bandas do movimento Gospel no Brasil.
Nos shows eles demonstram toda a paixão pelo que fazem, essa é a receita para manter a banda na ativa durante tanto tempo e com a mesma formação, são 90 minutos de rock n’roll onde o público canta do começo ao fim os sucessos do grupo.
O mais recente trabalho lançado pela banda foi o DVD “Aos Vivos” gravado em dezembro de 2012 em São Paulo e foi lançado pela Sony Music em Julho desse ano.
O DVD demostra que a banda está em sua melhor fase, já que apesar deles serem os “tios”do rock gospel eles ainda se divertem fazendo o que gostam.
Sempre renovado e com espírito firme o Resgate mantém sua música e sua mensagem conectados com o que realmente importa, sem cair em opções fáceis. Essência que ganha novos ares a cada dia.",3472,0,12,,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:9815244

Since he was just a little kid, Andhika learns how to turn his boredom into creativity. Accidentally in love with music since he knew how to play the bass and became a bassist player in many bands with various music genres, he is now expanding his creativity with something larger: composing film scores.
For music knows no limit, Andhika continuously works his magic with an integration of simple humming and a wide range of musical instruments: accordion, pianica, harmonica, Tek Yan (Chinese string instrument), Gambang Kromong (traditional Betawinese orchestra which combines gamelan, tinkling, tambourine, and drum), banjo, mandolin, trumpet, flugelhorn, saxophone to synthesizer and computer-based musical instruments.
With his ability to pour emotions into beautiful rhythm and imagination as secret weapons, this natural born artist always leaves his personal touch in every single masterpiece he created and marries art with professionalism",2022,5,58,5,11,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:17770009

About Marilyn Bradford:
I’ve always been a seeker – Always known that there had to be something greater, different – something that made more sense, was more expansive and less contractive. Something that was alive and joyful and fun! Something where I could shine, rather than adapt myself to other’s proscribed rules on how to live.
For many years I buried that awareness under a blanket of trying to fit in and play the roles I had been assigned to play. I was the good daughter, the teacher, the new wife, the intellectual, all the while feeling phony. I took up acting because it seemed the most real thing that I could do. At least it wasn’t a lie!
Still - I kept seeking. I tried all of the metaphysical things I could find including five kinds of meditation, astrology, tromping around India with a guru, and more! Finally, a friend introduced me to Access Consciousness.
With Access, I’ve not found the answer to my seeking; I’ve found the question – and that has made all the difference!
As a psychotherapist for many years, my target was always to empower people, yet I was stuck in a system of theories and answers. I finally realized that the purpose of traditional psychotherapy is to give people a better adjustment to this reality, not to empower them to move beyond and great something greater. The traditional recovery program for alcoholism, was even worse! I was in it for years, not knowing there was another possibility. It’s a fixed system of beliefs and limitations that’s applied to all who enter. All are doomed to an identity, a life time of meetings, steps, and no hope of ever beating addiction! Wow! No matter how hard I tried, that just wasn’t enough for me!
As I began applying the tools of Access to my psychotherapy clients, I noticed they were getting better faster, and without all of the trauma/drama. I approached Gary Douglas, the founder of Access Consciousness to see if we could do anything with Access and Addiction. He responded with a huge “YES!” and has been continuously contributing to me and Right Recovery For You. Working with Gary, I realized that the truth about addiction and recovery was light years away from how it was described and treated in this reality. Any and every addictive and compulsive behavior is absolutely beatable with the tools of Right Recovery For You – The Access Consciousness based empowering system for dealing with any addictive or compulsive behavior.",1045,2,102,13,,https://soundcloud.com/discover/sets/artist-stations:108276439
